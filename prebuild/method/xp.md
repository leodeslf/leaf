## Extreme Programming

<!-- It's a well-known agile method that integrates a range of good programming practices.

### Principles

#### You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

Only implement things when you **need** them, don't do them because you *think* you are gonna need it later.

#### Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work (DTSTTCPW)

Prioritize requirements and **do only the important** things. Don't do things you don't need, don't improve things if not needed. -->
