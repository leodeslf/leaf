### The Standard

Initialy designed by Brendan Eich, the **ECMA** **International**'s (European Computer Manufacturers Association) group **TC39** (Technical Committee number 39) is responsible for maintaining the **ECMA-262** (or ECMAScript Language Specification) which defines the **ECMAScript Language** (*ES* or *JavaScript*). It was first named Mocha, then LiveScript, and released in 1997 as JavaScript.

After its sixth version (*ES6* or *ES2015*), it's been releasd at least one "small" update per year instead of having a huge one after several years.

Other relevant standards:

- ECMA-402: *ES internationalization API specification*.
- ECMA-404: *JSON data interchange syntax*.
- ECMA-414: *ES specification suit* (ES and its required/optional built-in libraries).
- ECMA-419: *ES embedded systems API specification*.
