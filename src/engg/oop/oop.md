# Object Oriented Programming

Principles of OOP.

## Abstraction

It's the **pure concept of a requirement**, it does not rely on concrete implementation details. We use it to define "what we need the software to do", only then, based on that definition, we think about "how will it do it".

## Encapsulation

It's to **hide implementation details** (data or function members) that don't need to be visible from the outside (from any other object or non-object peace of software), thus we gain control over what can be accessed or not, and, at the same time, we avoid name collision between different interfaces.

>*Simula* was the first OOL, developed in the 60s in Norway.

## Inheritance

It's to **reuse data and function members** from a base implementation (a superclass) to a derived implementation (a subclass). That way we save time from developing and testing while still being able to make modifications to inherited members.

## Polymorphism

It's the **ability for an interface to change its value** (data or function value) while keeping the same name, as well as being able to exist in several objects, so each object will process the same message in a different manner.
