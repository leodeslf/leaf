# Visual Elements of User Interface Design

UI / UX Design Specialization by California Institute of Arts (CalArts).

## What is a User Interface?

It's the *bridge* between user and content/functionality.

## The Relationship between UI and UX

||UI|UX
---|---|---
**Defines**:|How it looks, the *visual design*.|How it feels, the *non-visual design*.
**Made of**:|Form, aesthetics, look & feel, organization.|Feel, navigation, story, structure.
**Driven by**:|Design driven.|User driven.

## A Brief Historical Overview of Interface Design

We need to have *feedback*, know when the interface is working or not, know if we make a mistake or if it's all right, and to be able to undo and redo our actions.

## Interface Conventions: Theory

An interface should be based on:

- Real world knowledge (analog models).
- Learned behaviour (conventions).
- Cause and effect (action / reaction).
- Consistency (logical / systematic).
- Seamless (speed and ease).
- Immediate intuition (a few teach a lot).
- Fulfillment (payoff / results).
- Undo / redo / confirm (feel safe).

## Template vs Content

To ensure we make the right interface, it should be based on **content**, **context**, and **functionality** for a specific, well defined **audience**.

A generic template *can* work for some UI elements or components. But *it won't work for the entire interface*, that leads us to a generic experience, a poor experience.

## Aesthetics & Functionality

Aesthetics and functionality are different things, but, UI should always be related and familiar to the functionality.

Relationship is making it easy to know **how it works** by **how it looks**.

## Design Before Design

**Project Brief** is the non-visual pre-design (how it all starts).

Here we define:

- What is it?
- Who is it for?
- Where does it live?

The client determines and must be clear about:

- Goals.
- Constraints.
- Platform.
- Audience.

## Look and Feel

Defining style and mood helps to envision the overall design (pre-design).

It defines:

- Mood.
- Typography.
- Color palette.
- Language.

## Language as a design tool

Language sets **mood** and **tone**.

We need to define *naming* and *branding* for the UI by specifying the audience, their *attitude* and *motivation* to use the app/web.

## Color & Shape

Use color and shape to define *association*, *functionality* and *state* of UI elements. That lets the user know if an element is disabled, active or inactive.

## Imagery

Kinds of imagery:

- **Imagery as content**: can be videos, search engines and all images in *boxes*.
- **Imagery as navigation**: they are icons, symbols and links to some other content or functionality.
- **Imagery as mood**: they contribute to the look and feel, and can be a part of the content or the navigation.
- **Immersive imagery**. It's a special case, it's used for games, apps and animations. By its own, they *create the context*, a whole world/universe for the product, where things don't have to "live" in boxes anymore.

## Typography

Type is language made physical, is *fast*, is *accurate*, and has a *clear meaning*, is *economical*, and can represent what cannot be depicted.

Types of typography:

- **Type as content**: typographic material, articles, blogs, books, etc.
- **Type as interface**: labels, buttons and navigation.
- **Type as branding**: the app or site identity.

## Icons

Difference between icons and symbols:

- **Icon**: pictorial representation (realistic/descriptive). We use to *know what an icon is*.
- **Symbol**: non-pictorial representation (abstract). We use to *learn what a symbol means*.

Sometimes a single image can act as both an icon and a symbol.

What makes a good icon?

- Communication (ideas + aesthetics).
- Functionality (technical).
- Audience (they get it!).
- Recognition (saturation + simplicity).

## Functionality

Creating a logical UI is creating a **predictable system**.

A UI must combine **logic**, **hierarchy** and **systematic** behaviours. While using the **intuition**, **discovery** and **learning**.

These facts help the user to interact fast and easily, as we make an economic interface. Economizing UI elements and user actions, saving time and doing more with less.

## Speed and Style

### Speed

Good|Bad
---|---
Simple / direct|Boring
Unambiguous|Boring
Rapidly adoptable|Boring
Familiar / predictable|Boring
Logical|Boring

### Style

Good|Bad
---|---
Entertaining|Obstructs Content
Engaging|Time-consuming
Rewarding experience|Frustrating experience
Brandable|Dates rapidly
Novel / individual|Unnecessary

## Composition and Structure

Content-specific design: Sometimes, the structure is the actual content, and its functionality drives all the design decisions.

## Buttons

Size: Must be related to the size of the *cursor*, *finger* and the *screen*.  
Shape: Meaningful for *functionality*, depending on its *label* and the *screen*.  
Color: It can make it easy to recognise *what a button is made for* (even without a label).  
Dimension: Making a button *similar* to a real one, makes the UI intuitive.  
System: Buttons need to have a *logic placement* on screen to make sense by themself.

## Not Buttons

Menus, links, fields. Use design conventions for these elements, for *shape*, *scale*, *contrast*, *clarity* and *economy*, in order to reinforce and emphasize the goals of speed and function.

## States and Changes

Let the user know the UI element is responsive (is working) by adding visual states, *normal*, *hover*, *active*, *inactive*.

Think about the different static element states as well as how your elements animate between states.

## Hierarchy of Content

Figure out *what goes where*, and *why*:

- **Function**, what's (and what's NOT) important to the user?
- **Intention**, what's (and what's NOT) important to the client?

It's critical to define **the scene**, **the thinking**, and **physical reaction** of the user:

- What's the first thing the user *sees*?
- What's the user's *first impression*?
- What's the first thing the user *does*?

## Conventions and Expectations

*Small screen: single task + multiple screens*.

By convention we focus on a single task when working on a small screen, even when multiple functions are available, we keep them hidden, until we need them.

*Big screen: multiple tasks + single screen*.

In this case, we can focus on multiple tasks on a single big screen as we have enough space to work.
