# Search Engine Optimization

A series of *practices and factors* to look after in order to **improve the online presence**.

<!-- crowler, indexing

- Click-through rate (CTR), higher is better
- Search engine ranking page (SERP)
- Bounce (entering a page and immediately clicking the back button), lower is better
- Dwell time (the time spend by the user in the site until clicking the back button), the longer the better
- Session duration
- Pages per session
- Outbound links
- Accessibility (`alt` attribute on images, `aria` [Accessible Rich Internet Applications] attributes)
- Meta tags (description, author, featured image, canonical url)

how the page content loads (try to do it fast)

- client-side rendering (render the HTML with JS in client's browser SPA). At the start the page is empty, then it loads the structure and content from scripts. Google will (hopefully) run JS by searching 
Tradeoffs
good: Great UX (just after loading)
bad: Slow to meaningful content. Might confuse bots

- static generation:
1. build pages in advance
1. cache on CDN
Tradeoff
good: fast bot-friendly content
bad: data can get stale. Does not scale well.

- server-side rendering (render on demand), bots get fully rendered html on the initial request
tradeoff
good: bot-friendly content
bad: slower. data fetching redundancy.

- incremental static regeneration (ISR)
tradeoff
good: fast, fresh, bot-friendly
bad: deployment complexity. Vendor lock-in
