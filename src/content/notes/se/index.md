# Software Engineering

>The question of whether computers can think is just like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1986)

Some *principles and mindsets* that every software engineer should follow.

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. (The Pragmatic Programmer)

Design, development, test, maintenance, and reusability will be easier by having a **single source of code**, then reuse it and modify it in another place as needed.

Opposite to:

- Copy And Paste Programming, **CAPP**.
- Clone And Modify Programming, **CAMP**.
- Write Everything Twice, **WET**.

## Egoless Programming

By Gerald M. Weinberg (The Psychology of Computer Programming, 1971).

The ten commandments of Egoless Programming:

- Understand and **accept that you will make mistakes**.
- **You are not your code**.
- No matter how much you know, **someone else will always know more than you**.
- **Don't rewrite code without consultation**.
- Treat people who know less than you with **respect and patience**.
- The only constant in the world is **change**.
- The only true **authority stems from knowledge**, not from position.
- Fight for what you believe, but **gracefully accept defeat**.
- **Don't be "the guy in the room"**.
- Critique code instead of people, **be kind to the coder, no to the code**.

## Keep it Simple, Stupid! (KISS)

What experts say:

>"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One is to make so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies; the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult." (Charles Antony Richard Hoare).

>"It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." (Antoine de Saint ExupÃ©ry).

>"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." (Leonardo da Vinci).

>"Less is more." (Mies Van Der Rohe).

In our software, methods should **solve only one problem**. Other problems should be solved by another block of code to be easily maintained. We need to do one thing and do it so it's easy to understand and replicate.

## Worth Mentioning

- **If it ain't broke, don't fix it**.
- **Measure twice, cut once**.
- **Ockham's Razor**, the simplest design should be selected.
- **Law of Demeter**, only talk to your friends, (Clean Coder, page 97).
- **Avoid Premature Optimization**.
