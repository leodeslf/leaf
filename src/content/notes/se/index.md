# Software Engineering

Some *principles and mindsets* of software engineering.

>The question of whether computers can think is just like the question of whether submarines can swim. -Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1986

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Design, development, test, maintenance, and reusability will be easier by having a **single source of code**, then reuse it and modify it in another place as needed.

Opposite to:

- Copy And Paste Programming, **CAPP**.
- Clone And Modify Programming, **CAMP**.
- Write Everything Twice, **WET**.

The Pragmatic Programmer:

>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

## Egoless Programming

By Geral M. Weinberg (The Psychology of Computer Programming, 1971).

The ten commandments of Egoless Programming:

- Understand and *accept that you will make mistakes*.
- *You are not your code*.
- No matter how much you know, *someone else will always know more than you*.
- *Don't rewrite code without consultation*.
- Treat people who know less than you with *respect and patience*.
- The only constant in the world is *change*.
- The only true *authority stems from knowledge*, not from position.
- Fight for what you believe, but *gracefully accept defeat*.
- *Don't be "the guy in the room"*.
- Critique code instead of people, *be kind to the coder*, no to the code.

## Keep it Simple, Stupid! (KISS)

Each method should solve **only one** problem. More problems, options, or conditions should be solved by another block of code to be easily maintained.

>It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. -Antoine de Saint ExupÃ©ry

...

>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. -Leonardo da Vinci

...

>Less is more. -Mies Van Der Rohe

## Worth Mentioning

- **If it ain't broke, don't fix it**.
- **Measure twice, cut once**.
- **Ockham's Razor**, the simplest design should be selected.
- **Law of Demeter**, only talk to your friends, (Clean Coder, page 97).
- **Avoid Premature Optimization**.
