# Data Visualization

## How to Data Visualization

- Ingredients --> Data Quality & Variety
- Technique --> Data Processing & Preparation
- Presentation --> Data Visualization, think well what we are trying to communicate through the visualizations.

## Main Functions of Analytics Systems

- Data **exploration**, it is to *search for relationships, patterns, and facts* about either hidden or explicitly shown information by the available raw data.
- Data **explanation**, it's to show that information and try to *justify and make evident* what we have discovered by even adding more data such as *estimations, measurements*, and formulas.

>Data is common, logic is rare.

- It's more important to know **what we are trying to communicate** visually to say with a graphic than it is to *just show the actual data*.
- A good graphic is the one who **answers a specific question to a specific role**.
- We are bad at reading tables and numbers, graphs solve that.
- A *single data set* might be used to show **different insights in different graphs**.
- We provide organizations with *evidence not analytics*.

## Avoid optical illusions and color blindness

shape sizes, diagonal lines, 3d effects and 3d bars, grid lines textures.

## Use Verbiage Carefully

It can add some needed context to the dashboard with an appropriate language, but we should not abuse/use much.

<!-- ## Data Visualization Scenarios

To design a visualization we should know *who* needs it and *when* they need it. There are two general cases for **who is receiving the information**: it can be either *role-specific individuals*; or the *whole organization*. There are also two cases for the **timing in which they need to respond** to that information: they can either respond *by deduction to take deliberate action* in the mid to long-term; or *by intuition to take immediate action* in the short-term or even a matter of seconds.

The four data visualization *scenarios* are:

- **Data discovery** (individuals with deliberate response).
- **Situational awareness** (individuals with immediate response).
- **Business intelligence dashboards** (organizations with deliberate response).
- **Alerts & thresholds**: (organizations with immediate response). -->
