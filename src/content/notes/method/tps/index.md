# Toyota Production System

>[Research and innovation] are areas that we should develop on our own without relying on anyone else; we cannot hope to [succeed] by simply imitating [someone else's] technology. In fact, it is only by [pioneering and] walking our own path that we will surpass developed countries and develop the capability to contribute to a new civilization. (Kiichiro Toyoda, founder of the Toyota Motors Corporation, 1942)

The Toyota Production System (TPS) is **a management philosophy** based on *Just in Time* and *Jidoka* philosophies, both concepts were adopted by Taiichi Ohno since the mid-40s, who developed and applied them systematically at a large scale. His work produced and popularized concepts such as *Kaizen*, the relentless search for improvement; *Lean* (Manufacturing), based on Kaizen plus the Human Potential & Collaboration; and *Kanban*, a way to monitor and visualize the progress of processes, among other mindsets, models, and methods. It's believed that the complete development of the TPS took about 25 years. New revisions and updates have been made through the years since then.

Similarity between the first years of Toyota as a car manufacturer vs Agile Manifesto ("Working software over comprehensive documentation"):

>When creating a prototype, [Kiichiro Toyoda] first got an engineer to make it, and if it worked, then he got an academic to figure aut the theory. (Jirokichi Chigusa, director of Toyoda Machinery Works, 1935)

Absence of own-investigation:

>There are times when we need to [consume] the achievements of others as is. But [by doing so], we only learn how to enjoy the benefits and we, in the end, lack the power and drive to further advance those innovations. If we want to truly [become] independent, we have to cultivate that drive. (Kiichiro Toyoda, founder of Toyota Motors Corporation, 1942)

Taiichi Ohno on defining a manager:

- >Make an environment where it’s OK to say, “I’m sorry”.
- >Management should make workplaces that motivate people to work and sustain the motivation.
- >[A manager is the] one who makes people do their job well in an easy way.
- >Giving authority: growing people you can empower.
- >Managers are there to create an environment in which increases in flow happen.
