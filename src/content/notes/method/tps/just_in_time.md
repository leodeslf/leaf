# Just in Time

Just in Time (JIT) is **an inventory strategy** for manufacturing *production and stock management*. It was thought to *reduce and avoid the wastes* caused by the standardized ways of working in Europe and the US. Kiichiro Toyoda learned about those models and introduced the idea back in 1937 as *an optimization of state of the art in manufacturing* (and founded the Toyota Motors Corporation).

Kiichiro considered that the current working method generated unnecessary inventory, in consequence waste of *storage space; production time; invested capital; raw-materials*; etc. This concept was then grown, improved and implemented by Taiichi Ohno as part of the Toyota Production System.
