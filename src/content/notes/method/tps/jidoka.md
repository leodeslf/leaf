# Jidoka

Jidoka, **a philosophy** that makes automatic *machines capable of detecting abnormalities by themselves so that they stop working on their own*. This is an augmentation of their capabilities as they are not only repetitive-task-runners, e.i. automatic; but also independent-action-takers, autonomous (something we take for granted now a days).

Two key **benefits of jidoka** are: first, *detaching people from machines* so they no longer need to constantly watch over them, which is a misuse of human potential as they could be doing something else (the ratio of machines-per-worker went from 1:1 to 25:1); second, *preventing machines from delivering defects* down the production line, hence eliminating waste (of time, raw materials, energy, etc) and the actual loss of quality from the product.

...

It all started within the 1905-1924 with the loom machines invented by Sakichi Toyoda and the improvements he developed among his son Kiichiro.

Mr. Sakichi literally represented the idea of **adding a human labor into the machine itself** by modifying (the standard ji-do-ka) 自動化: *self-motion-ization, automation*; to be (the Toyoda's ji-do-ka) 自働化: *self-labor-ization, autonomation* (autonomous + automation).

In 1936 *jidoka was grown and implemented systematically at a large scale* by Taiichi Ohno, with the backing of Eiji Toyoda (a Kiichiro's cousin), who worked on an advanced, complex manufacturing approach, the *Toyota Production System* (TPS), a work that took up to the 1970 to finish. Shingeo Shingo called autonomation "pre-automation" because the invention of Mr. Sakichi was not autonomous enough.

<!-- Jidoka is **a pioneering philosophy** of making automatic or non-automatic machines that are capable of *detecting anomalies so that they stop working on their own*,  -->
<!-- which brings two key benefits: first, *detaching people from machines* as they are no longer needed to constantly watch over them (the ratio of machines per worker went from 1:1 to 25:1); -->
<!-- second, eliminating waste and loss of quality by *preventing machines from delivering defects* down the line. -->

<!-- In summary, jidoka is to make *a machine able to detect defects*; an automatic machine should also *stop itself* (and the production line if needed); in case of Modern Manufacturing (i.e.: an electronic machine), it should make use of lights/sounds in order to *call attention* so that a worker can immediately address the problem. It is to **make machines more valuable, like humans**. -->
