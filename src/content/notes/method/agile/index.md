- **Communication**; direct and frequent; to value informal, non-scheduled talks; real, face-to-face interactions among every team member (including devs., managers, and clients).
- **Feedback**; what the team's efficiency depends on; to keep everyone up-to-date about what's not going well; updating the people who takes decisions as soon as possible; enable and enhance early decision making.
