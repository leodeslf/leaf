# Scrum

Scrum is **an Agile framework** aimed to *incrementally deliver value* through *collaborative work* by defining rules, boundaries, roles, and structure for each one and each stage for projects with challenging, *complex problems* and *rapidly changing requirements*.

## Scrum Origins

The word "scrum" (or "rugby approach") was brought to product development by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka on their paper **"The New New Product Development Game"** in the 1986, where they analyzed new approaches that lead them to better understand how can we *enhance development speed and flexibility*, both well-known weak points of old, sequential methods. Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland co-created Scrum based on it (1995) inheriting the *Agile philosophy*. Later, Mike Beedle wrapped Scrum around *XP practices and artifacts*.

That paper identified six key characteristics leading companies had:

1. *Built-in instability*, teams with great freedom of action but also hard, challenging goals.
1. *Self-organizing project teams* which are identified by three must-have traits: autonomy (from top managers and directors), self-transcendence (making them and top managers forget about status quo and recognize that they can always be auto-sufficient), and cross-fertilization (as cross-functional, multi-disciplinary team members are constantly sharing knowledge and initiatives while working together).
1. *Overlapping development phases*, which "enhance shared responsibility and cooperation, stimulates involvement and commitment, sharpens a problem-solving focus, encourages initiative taking, [and] develops diversified skills." On the other hand, management becomes more complex and good communication skills become a must-have for everyone.
1. *"Multilearning,"* it happens in two dimensions. One is multilevel learning: the pressure imposed by the challenges and teammates lead everyone to learn more and grow because it is a necessity. The other is multifunctional learning: members from a cross-functional team have the privilege but also the requirement to learn about multiple tools and disciplines. Interactive experimentation also rises initiative and organizational flexibility.
1. *Subtle control*, although top managers give teams great freedom, they provide a "big picture" point of view preventing small problems, ambiguity, and tension from turning into total chaos. Traditional management is avoided as it impairs or even extinguishes creativity and innovation. Subtle control includes self-discipline control, peer (instead of "boss") pressure, and passion/love (for what you do). Healthy management control exercises:
   1. Build balanced teams by selecting the right people.
   1. Creating an open work environment.
   1. Make team members to research costumer requirements by themselves.
   1. Establishing a group performance evaluation & reward system.
   1. Helping regulate team members working rhythm (specially at the start).
   1. Tolerating & anticipating mistakes.
   1. Make (external) suppliers self-organizing and knowledgeable about our needs.
1. *(Organizational) transfer of learning* to other teams facing new projects or even different divisions. It is appropriate to assigning key members to new projects, so we leverage the accumulation of knowledge, something called transfer of learning through "osmosis," or now a days, to prevent silos of knowledge. It is also key to standardize practices through the whole organization for later projects. To institutionalize lessons learned from success. Yet, excessive institutionalization can be bad. Unlearning lessons when required by environment changes is crucial to keep a realistic, up-to-date organization culture.

Observed limitations and undesired effects:

- *Remarkably more effort is required* on the part of team members in order to execute such speed and complexity. People may suffer from more stress and tension.
- *May not apply for long-term revolutionary innovations*, that kind of projects may require more rigid team structures and less volatile processes and practices.
- *May not apply for extremely large projects* involving multiple divisions or organizations. Coordination, face-to-face communication, and speed can get hurt by the project's scale.
- *Does not apply for one-man "teams"* where a single in charge "genius" develops the project to then define strict and specific orders for the people "below" to follow.

## Scrum Philosophy

Scrum is supported by three *pillars*:

- **Transparency**: in order to avoid misinformation, misunderstandings, and rise collective ownership, we shall *keep information always available and accesible for everyone*, such as practices, progress, problems, and any other relevant content.
- **Inspection**: we shall *have self-critic and discipline in order to spot potential issues* by periodically reviewing the produced work, monitoring the effectiveness of our practices, and the smoothness on each step of the process. Empiricism is the key mindset.
- **Adaption**: whether it comes from customer needs, consumer trends, economics, etc., or introduced by ourselves, change is inevitable and we need flexibility in order to deal with it; we shall *accept context-imposed changes as well as promote our own ones when appropriate*.

>With no trust, scrum's efficiency is not low, it is zero. (Me)

These pillars stand on a single *foundation*:

- **Trust**: programming is a team effort; every team member is treated as someone independent and accountable; we believe on each other's talent and knowledge; to collaborating with efficiency *it is essential to build strong relationships*; with no regards to positions, titles, status quo, etc., we *recognize each person's capabilities to add value* on their own.

Scrum *values*, traits a team needs to have success:

- **Commitment**: to overcome any difficulty and achieve the team's defined goals.
- **Focus**: on prioritizing and delivering only the value that's been required.
- **Openness**: to be transparent about requirements and emerging challenges.
- **Respect**: to recognize and appreciate every team member's capabilities.
- **Courage**: to be determined and brave to face the complex and unknown.

## How to Scrum

>Scrum is not a silver-bullet. It does not bring success. [...] The effort is great and those that succeed will be in the minority. (Ken Schwaber, co-creator of Scrum)

What the Scrum's "guide" looks like:

- At least three roles are defined: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **team member**.
- The Product Owner is the one who brings required features and their priorities as **user stories**, which will be put in the **product backlog**.
- The software is build through **sprints**. Each sprint starts with a **sprint planning** to choose which features will be built, these features are moved to the **sprint backlog**.
- Every day the team holds a short, face-to-face meeting, the **Daily Scrum** to update the progress, report difficulties and, if needed, ask for help.
- The Scrum Master's responsibility is to ensure the project runs as smoother as possible helping other team members address their issues. He also facilitates the team's meetings such as the **sprint review**, where the team demonstrates the product to the product owner at the end of each sprint, after that, the team also holds a **retrospective** meeting to reflect about learned lessons and ways to improve.

>Practices in the absence of ... principles are often inappropriately used. (Agile Project Management, Jim Highsmith, 2009)

However, as any other method, *Scrum does not fix chaotic circumstances*; a guide is not enough; in order to succeed we need *self-organization*, *collective commitment*, and a lot of effort.

## Scrum Values

Value|Description
---|---
**Commitment**|The Scrum Team commits to *achieving its goals* and to *supporting each other*.
**Focus**|Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to *make the best possible progress* toward these goals.
**Openness**|The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are *open about the work and the challenges*.
**Respect**|Scrum *Team members respect each other* to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
**Courage**|The Scrum Team members have the courage to *do the right thing*, to *work on tough problems*.

## Scrum Theory

Theory|Description
---|---
**Transparency**|Important decisions must be *visible to all the team all the time* and be based on the three artifacts. It enables inspection otherwise it is misleading and wasteful.
**Inspection**|The three artifacts and progress must be *inspected frequently and diligently* to detect potential problems. It's pointless to inspect without adaptation. Scrum is designed to provoke change.
**Adaptation**|If any aspect of a process is unacceptable, the process or the product must be *adjusted as soon as possible*.

## Scrum Team

It consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. There are no sub-teams or hierarchies. If the Scrum Master or Product Owner are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

The Scrum Team is **cross-functional** and **self-managing**. It is focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.

Typically *10 or fewer people*. Smaller teams tend to communicate better and to be more productive.

### Developers

They are committed to **creating** any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint.

They create the plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog, adapting that plan every day defining what is done, and holding each other as professionals.

### Product Owner

The person who ensures the right features make into the Product Backlog and maximize its value for each Sprint, **representing the customers** of the product.

Responsible for the *Product Backlog management*, developing and communicating its items and the whole Product Goal, ordering and keeping it transparent, visible, and understandable.

### Scrum Master

Is who makes sure the project is progressing smoothly, and any member of the team has the tools they need to get their job done. Sets up meetings, **monitors** the working being done and **facilitates** release planning.

Helps the Product Owner with techniques for the Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management.

Also serves the organization by *leading*, *training*, and *coaching* to understand the Scrum theory and practice, both the Scrum Team and the organization.

## Scrum Events

Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to **inspect and adapt** Scrum artifacts.

### The Sprint

They are fixed length events of *one month or less*. A new Sprint starts immediately after the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to *achieve the Product Goal*, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
- Quality does not decrease.
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed.
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner.

Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint.

### Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of *eight hours*.

It *initiates the Sprint* by laying out the work to be performed. The resulting plan is created by the entire Scrum Team and even other people invited to provide advice.

Sprint Planning topics:

1. **Why is this Sprint valuable?** Here the Sprint Goal must be finalized to define the plan relative to it.
1. **What can be Done this Sprint?** Developers and the Product Owner select items from the Products Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
1. **How will the chosen work get done?** Developers and the Product Backlog plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

### Daily Scrum

It's a *15-minute* event for Developers to *inspect and adapt* the Sprint Backlog as necessary. Each Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place *every working day*. It produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

### Sprint Review

Sprint Review's purpose is to *inspect the outcome of the Sprint* and determine future adaptations.

During the event, the Scrum Team presents the *results* of their work to key stakeholders, everyone reviews what was accomplished and what has changed in their environment. The product Backlog may be adjusted.

It's the second to last event, and it's timeboxed to a maximum of *four hours*.

### Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to *increase quality and effectiveness*.

The Scrum Team inspects *how the last Sprint went* with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work.

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It's timeboxed to a maximum of *three hours*.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum's artifacts represent **work or value**. They are designed to *maximize transparency*, thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

Each artifact contains a *commitment* to ensure it provides information against which progress can be measured:

- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.

### Product Backlog

It's a **list of what is needed** to improve the product. It's the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

Items from it that can be Done within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They acquire this level of transparency after refining activities. Refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as description, order, size, etc.

The Developers are responsible for the sizing.

The Product Owner may influence by helping understand and select trade-offs.

#### Commitment: Product Goal

It describes a *future state of the product*, it is in the Product Backlog, the rest of the Product Backlog items emerge to define "what" will fulfill the Product Goal.

>A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.

The Product Goal is the *long-term objective* for the Scrum Team.

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is a **plan to accomplish the Sprint**, made by and for the Developers to have a visible and real-time picture of the work progress. It's composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for that Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

#### Commitment: Sprint Goal

It's the *single objective* for the Sprint. It creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.

If the work turns out to be different than the expected, the Developers collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.

### Increment

An Increment is a **concrete stepping stone** toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior ones, the results are verified and working together, the sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.

#### Commitment: Definition of Done

It's a *formal description of the state* of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.

It creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.
