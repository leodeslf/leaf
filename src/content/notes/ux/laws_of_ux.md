# Laws of UX

## Jakob's Law

>Users spend most of their time on other sites. They would prefer (and expect) our site to work the same way other sites do. (Jakob Nielsen, 2000)

**Users want to do, not to learn how to do**. The best scenario is to have the opportunity to "use" other sites as the source of knowledge, where users experienced some friction because they had to learn, think, and adapt to it, while our site is the place where that knowledge just needs to be applied. It's all about *reducing the overall mental effort, lowering the cognitive load* required to operate our site, so users are more likely to successfully achieve their goals.

When users enter a new site that is similar to other(s) they already know, *they expect that new site to work the same way* as the first one does because of the **mental models** they've built. Being familiar helps users feel comfortable. That's why we should *make use of well-known patterns, conventions, and standards* to avoid unnecessary work.

One of the biggest challenges for designers is to *align our own mental models with the ones of the users*. To assume **we do not know the users' mental model** is a good starting point. *Ask, interview, and research* not only about the users' goals, but also about the users' previous experiences and how that information can be applied to our own design.
