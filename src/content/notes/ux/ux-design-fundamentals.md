# UX Design Fundamentals

UI / UX Design Specialization by California Institute of Arts (CalArts).

## Ideation

Take ideas. Ideas come from _client_. Ideas should be about **content**, **concept** and **needs**.

- Good ideas
  - Real problems
  - Solvable by app
  - Loved by users
- Good process
  - Research
  - Testing
  - Revisions
- Good focus
  - Articulation
  - Clarity
  - User feedback

### Goals

We need to know:

- **What does it do?** For Ideation & Articulation.
- **How does it work?** For Research & Development.
- **Who benefits from it?** For Audience & Rationale.
- **Why would someone use it?** For Goals & Outcomes.

## Research & Development

Check out the _competition_:

- What apps exist that do the same thing?
- What apps do something similar?
- What apps are content-adjacent?
- What apps are structural models?

Develop and test new ideas. Map possibilities. Shape your solution.

## Audience & Rationale

Identify your _audience_:

- Who benefits from my app?
- Who is my audience?
- Who is my _initial_ user target group?

Differentiate audience through political, economic, social, functional and other categories.

That is **User Centered Design**.

## Goals & Outcomes

We need to define 100% between:

- **Political**: Fulfill out _main objective_.
- **Financial**: Make money.
- **Social**: Build community.
- **Functional**: Provide a useful app.

## Naming and Mission

Naming has to have a topic to be based on (mythological, contemporary, scientific, historical, fictional, etc). Mission needs to be concise, descriptive and pragmatic.

Here we need **keywords** and a **mind map** for defining our **language**.

Always keeping in mind the appropriate **tone** and **mood** for the brand.

## Mapping Content & Interaction

The process comes from non-visual, **app idea** (words). To semi-visual, **envision** (words, maps, sketches). Then, visual, **prototype** (experience, final designs).

So we start the _content mapping_, _developing ideas_, making _paper prototypes_ for some _testing_ and the _visual development_, the actual UI. We also do _wireframing_, _functionality_ / _logic_, some _visual refinement_ and check the _continuity_ / _coherence_ of the UI system.

### Mapping Content

Identify the _main objective_ (usually as home page), each _module_ and its _attributes_, and the potential to _grow by itself_ (scale). It's a **diagram** / map.

### Mapping Interaction

Think about the users possible _pathways_, from the start, to all the _actions_ he can make, all the _inputs_ that should be needed (even optional ones). Independent of visuals, UI elements or specific screens. It's a **flowchart** / map.

## Non-Visual Testing

### Paper Prototyping

All mapped ideas have to be put on paper, making _revisions_, _moving parts around_ as needed, and looking for _changes_. It's an _internal_ test, developers by themselves will see if the prototype works or not.

### User Testing

Here the user will be _taking decisions_ from the available _options_, _interacting_ with the system and, if it's all fine, doing what he is supposed to do with the app. Also telling testers whether or not there is a _problem_, something that can't be done or understood.

## Sitemap

A site map is a **hierarchical diagram** of a web / app, that shows how pages are _prioritized_, _linked_, and _labeled_. If the flowchart is like the street view, the sitemap is like the bird's eye view.

Process scheme:

1. Content Map & Interaction Map.
2. Paper Prototyping ⟶ Testing UX ⟶ User Testing UX.
3. Sitemap (_here we are_).
4. Wireframe ⟶ Testing UI.
5. Prototyping ⟶ Testing UI ⟶ User Testing UI.

## Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status.
2. Match between the system and the real world.
3. User control and freedom.
4. Consistency and standards.
5. Error prevention.
6. Recognition rather than recall.
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.
10. Help and documentation.

## Wireframe

A wireframe defines **what goes where**.

They are functional, minimal, consistent, and user-centric. Simple and clear.

Creating a wireframe:

- Sketch (hand or computer).
- Geometric shapes and lines.
- Scale and hierarchy.
- Don't get lost in details.
- Black and white, and grey.
- Placement on screen.
- Reuse elements.
- Visually indicate the type of interface elements.

## Prototype

It's made for:

- _Simulating_ the final experience.
- _Refining_ final UI and UX.
- Creating a digital prototype for _realistic_ user testing.

It must simulate:

- The **platform**:
  - Scale (relates to eye).
  - Physicality (relates to body).
  - Visual + Tactile (together).
- The **interface**:
  - Believable UI design.
  - Believable content.
  - Believable language.
- The **Interaction**:
  - Believable UX design.
  - Believable path.
  - Believable responses.
- The **experience**:
  - Believable UI design (needs to be on a screen).
  - Believable UX design (needs to be interactive).
  - Believable platform / context (needs to be a physical device).
