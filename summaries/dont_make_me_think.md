# Don't Make Me Think

Written by Steve Krug.

## Guiding Principles

### Don't make me think

>Krig's first law of usability.

People doesn't read, *people does scan*, they should be capable of **instantly finding what they need** without waisting time and effort, where is it, how to use it, or even identifying more options. Webs should be *self-explanatory and speak the users language*.

If you can't make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.

### How we really use the Web

>Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through.

Sometimes *people doesn't use the Web the way we spect* as designers and developers.

*People is usually in a hurry*. As said before, **they don't read pages, they scan them**. We need (or want) to get something done fast. We try to find the closest option that looks relevant to us, even if it's not the right one.

In reality, most of the time people don't make an optimal choice, **people guess** and choose the most reasonable option. Usually getting wrong, but, when they're right, **it's faster**, surprising and pleasant.

Sometimes *people don't actually know how things work*, **they muddle through**. It's not important for them to ignore things, however, if they know, they'll feel smarter.

### Billboard Design 101

>Designing for scanning, not reading.

- **Take advantage of conventions**:  
Standards and **conventions are the safest solutions**. Innovate when *you know you have a better idea* that is clear, self-explanatory, and doesn't hurt consistancy.

- **Create effective visual hierarchies**:  
Make obvious which things are **more important**, what things **does**, and what things **are part of**. In other words show visual cues about *hierarchy*, *functionality* and *relationship*.

- **Break pages up into clearly defined areas**:  
Divide the page into clearly defined areas so users can easily **decide which areas to focus** on, and what they can ignore.

- **Make it obvious what's clickable**  
On the Web, *almost all we can do are clicks*. Use visual cues to **show what's clickable**, color, shape, underlining, location, and more.

- **Eliminate distractions**:  
Reduce visual noise. **Clamoring for attention, disorganizaiton, and clutter is overwhelming**. All of that leads to lots of noise, not much information, and noise obscures the usefull stuff.

- **Format content to support scanning**:  
Use **headings** and make them distinctive. **Keep paragraphs short**, avoid creating a "wall of words". Use **bulleted lists** whenever you can. **Highlight key terms** when appropriate.

### Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

>Why users like mindless choices.

People don't care how many clicks they have to make, but **how much they have to think** to make them. If you know something is difficult, give some help, **guidance should be brief, timely, and unavoidable**.

### Omit needless words

>The art of not writing for the web.

By **writing less**, we reduce the noise level, make the useful content more prominent, and save time for the users. Try to avoid *happy talk*, *small talk*, and *instructions* on your products.

## Things You Need to Get Right

### Street signs and Breadcrumbs
