<p>UI / UX Design Specialization by California Institute of Arts (CalArts).</p>
<h3>What is a User Interface?</h3>
<p>It's the <em>bridge</em> between user and content/functionality.</p>

<h3>A Brief Historical Overview of Interface Design</h3>
<p>We need to have <em>feedback</em>, know when the interface is working or not, know if we make a mistake or if it's all right, and to be able to undo and redo our actions.</p>
<h3>Interface Conventions: Theory</h3>
<p>An interface should be based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real world knowledge (analog models).</li>
<li>Learned behaviour (conventions).</li>
<li>Cause and effect (action / reaction).</li>
<li>Consistency (logical / systematic).</li>
<li>Seamless (speed and ease).</li>
<li>Immediate intuition (a few teach a lot).</li>
<li>Fulfillment (payoff / results).</li>
<li>Undo / redo / confirm (feel safe).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Template vs Content</h3>
<p>To ensure we make the right interface, it should be based on <strong>content</strong>, <strong>context</strong>, and <strong>functionality</strong> for a specific, well defined <strong>audience</strong>.</p>
<p>A generic template <em>can</em> work for some UI elements or components. But <em>it won't work for the entire interface</em>, that leads us to a generic experience, a poor experience.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics &amp; Functionality</h3>
<p>Aesthetics and functionality are different things, but, UI should always be related and familiar to the functionality.</p>
<p>Relationship is making it easy to know <strong>how it works</strong> by <strong>how it looks</strong>.</p>
<h3>Design Before Design</h3>
<p><strong>Project Brief</strong> is the non-visual pre-design (how it all starts).</p>
<p>Here we define:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is it?</li>
<li>Who is it for?</li>
<li>Where does it live?</li>
</ul>
<p>The client determines and must be clear about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goals.</li>
<li>Constraints.</li>
<li>Platform.</li>
<li>Audience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Look and Feel</h3>
<p>Defining style and mood helps to envision the overall design (pre-design).</p>
<p>It defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mood.</li>
<li>Typography.</li>
<li>Color palette.</li>
<li>Language.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Language as a design tool</h3>
<p>Language sets <strong>mood</strong> and <strong>tone</strong>.</p>
<p>We need to define <em>naming</em> and <em>branding</em> for the UI by specifying the audience, their <em>attitude</em> and <em>motivation</em> to use the app/web.</p>
<h3>Color &amp; Shape</h3>
<p>Use color and shape to define <em>association</em>, <em>functionality</em> and <em>state</em> of UI elements. That lets the user know if an element is disabled, active or inactive.</p>
<h3>Imagery</h3>
<p>Kinds of imagery:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagery as content</strong>: can be videos, search engines and all images in <em>boxes</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery as navigation</strong>: they are icons, symbols and links to some other content or functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Imagery as mood</strong>: they contribute to the look and feel, and can be a part of the content or the navigation.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive imagery</strong>. It's a special case, it's used for games, apps and animations. By its own, they <em>create the context</em>, a whole world/universe for the product, where things don't have to &quot;live&quot; in boxes anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>Type is language made physical, is <em>fast</em>, is <em>accurate</em>, and has a <em>clear meaning</em>, is <em>economical</em>, and can represent what cannot be depicted.</p>
<p>Types of typography:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type as content</strong>: typographic material, articles, blogs, books, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Type as interface</strong>: labels, buttons and navigation.</li>
<li><strong>Type as branding</strong>: the app or site identity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>Difference between icons and symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Icon</strong>: pictorial representation (realistic/descriptive). We use to <em>know what an icon is</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Symbol</strong>: non-pictorial representation (abstract). We use to <em>learn what a symbol means</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a single image can act as both an icon and a symbol.</p>
<p>What makes a good icon?</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication (ideas + aesthetics).</li>
<li>Functionality (technical).</li>
<li>Audience (they get it!).</li>
<li>Recognition (saturation + simplicity).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Creating a logical UI is creating a <strong>predictable system</strong>.</p>
<p>A UI must combine <strong>logic</strong>, <strong>hierarchy</strong> and <strong>systematic</strong> behaviours. While using the <strong>intuition</strong>, <strong>discovery</strong> and <strong>learning</strong>.</p>
<p>These facts help the user to interact fast and easily, as we make an economic interface. Economizing UI elements and user actions, saving time and doing more with less.</p>

<h3>Composition and Structure</h3>
<p>Content-specific design: Sometimes, the structure is the actual content, and its functionality drives all the design decisions.</p>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p>Size: Must be related to the size of the <em>cursor</em>, <em>finger</em> and the <em>screen</em>.<br>
Shape: Meaningful for <em>functionality</em>, depending on its <em>label</em> and the <em>screen</em>.<br>
Color: It can make it easy to recognise <em>what a button is made for</em> (even without a label).<br>
Dimension: Making a button <em>similar</em> to a real one, makes the UI intuitive.<br>
System: Buttons need to have a <em>logic placement</em> on screen to make sense by themself.</p>
<h3>Not Buttons</h3>
<p>Menus, links, fields. Use design conventions for these elements, for <em>shape</em>, <em>scale</em>, <em>contrast</em>, <em>clarity</em> and <em>economy</em>, in order to reinforce and emphasize the goals of speed and function.</p>
<h3>States and Changes</h3>
<p>Let the user know the UI element is responsive (is working) by adding visual states, <em>normal</em>, <em>hover</em>, <em>active</em>, <em>inactive</em>.</p>
<p>Think about the different static element states as well as how your elements animate between states.</p>
<h3>Hierarchy of Content</h3>
<p>Figure out <em>what goes where</em>, and <em>why</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Function</strong>, what's (and what's NOT) important to the user?</li>
<li><strong>Intention</strong>, what's (and what's NOT) important to the client?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's critical to define <strong>the scene</strong>, <strong>the thinking</strong>, and <strong>physical reaction</strong> of the user:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the first thing the user <em>sees</em>?</li>
<li>What's the user's <em>first impression</em>?</li>
<li>What's the first thing the user <em>does</em>?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conventions and Expectations</h3>
<p><em>Small screen: single task + multiple screens</em>.</p>
<p>By convention we focus on a single task when working on a small screen, even when multiple functions are available, we keep them hidden, until we need them.</p>
<p><em>Big screen: multiple tasks + single screen</em>.</p>
<p>In this case, we can focus on multiple tasks on a single big screen as we have enough space to work.</p>
