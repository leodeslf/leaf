      <h2>Lean</h2>
<p>Lean is a <strong>mindset</strong> (aka Lean Thinking) that aims to make smarter decisions about how to invest resources (such as time, energy, and money) to <em>eliminate waste</em> and to <em>consume less</em>. That's made by promoting the total commitment of team members as <em>problem solvers</em>, while putting <em>customer satisfaction</em> as the main target. Therefore, <em>adding customer-defined value</em> to products and services, which improves the overall business performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lean is both a philosophy and a discipline which, at its core, increases access to information to ensure responsible decision making in the service of creating customer value. -Jim Benson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the modern conception of Lean as a business mindset/methodology to be applied in almost any industry, it was originally an approach to the manufacturing process of Toyota known as the <em>Toyota Production System</em> (TPS), developed by Taiichi Ohno in the 1950s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's nothing so useless as doing something efficiently that should not be done at all. -Peter Drucker, known as the &quot;Management guru&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Pillars of Lean</h3>
<h4>Respect for People</h4>
<p>It is well known that <em>the best ideas come from the people with their hands on the product</em>, that's why it's so important to <em>listen to them</em> and value their opinion. By encouraging team members to be proactive to <em>share their insights</em> and ideas, we ensure that any kind of problem to be eliminated or possibility to improve will be identified and used as an opportunity to optimize the process of production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go see, ask why, show respect. -Fujio Cho, Toyota Motor Corporation</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Continuous Improvement</h4>
<p>We must believe that <em>there is always a way to improve</em> processes. <em>Improvement is a daily activity triggered by everyone</em> in the organization. It's the actual mindset of Lean. We should encourage team members to <em>foster a learning mindset</em> to identify opportunities to create value for the customer. Often, improvement cycles such as PDSA (plan, do, study, act) or DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, control), among other tools, are used to efficiently organize, measure, and report on Lean activities.</p>
<h3>The Lean Principles</h3>
<h4>Value</h4>
<p>We need to research our customer's business to identify what's valuable and have a good understanding of <em>what the customer is willing to pay for</em>. No one knows better their business needs, that's why <em>value is always defined by the customer</em>.</p>
<p>Value can be categorized in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Non-value add activity</em> (which is waste).</li>
<li><em>Value add activity</em>.</li>
<li><em>Business values add activity</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example questions to identify value:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the customer's requirements?</li>
<li>When and why do they need them to be met?</li>
<li>How can our product fulfill their requirements?</li>
<li>When and how will we be able to deliver the product they require?</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Value Stream</h4>
<p>It's the result of the <strong>Value Stream Mapping</strong>, the <em>step-by-step definition</em> of the process in which we need to identify <em>each activity and actor</em> involved to get to the final product. That mapping allows us to see <em>how much value each stage contributes</em> to the result. Therefore, the value stream indicates which steps do not add enough value and should be removed, or at least optimized.</p>
<h4>Flow</h4>
<p>The flow refers to the value stream workflow. Once we have mapped the value stream, we need to ensure the whole <em>process runs smoothly</em>, without any delay or interruption, aiming to <em>enhance its efficiency</em>. Almost every process of production is likely to require cross-functional teamwork. Lean seeks to have <em>every process in sync</em> with every other.</p>
<p>Questions that can help us optimize and keep the flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the necessary tools for each step of the process?</li>
<li>Is every tool necessary at every point in the process?</li>
<li>Can we minimize the time delay between two steps?</li>
<li>How can we reduce the number of steps required to deliver?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pull</h4>
<p>It is to <em>produce only what we need</em> when it's needed, instead of producing (and storing) a lot of materials and products to be (hopefully) used in the future, which may result in waste. It's meant to improve the <em>productivity and efficiency</em> of the processes, it contributes directly with the objective of consuming less. The concept was an industry-changing approach created by Toyota.</p>
<h4>Perfection</h4>
<p>The <em>relentless pursuit of perfection</em> is not only one of the two pillars of Lean, but it's also a principle. The Lean mindset suggests that it's not enough to just improve things, but we need to be <em>always looking for new ways of improving</em> them by applying rigorous measurements and analyzing results during the entire process. Also, we need to be aware that (new) problems can occur at any time.</p>
<h3>The Seven Wastes</h3>
<p>A critical practice to achieve the goal of Lean is to <em>eliminate waste</em>. That's why it's worth mentioning the <em>Seven Wastes</em> model developed by Taiichi Ohno, who introduced <em>Lean</em>, <em>Kanban</em>, <em>Just-in-time</em> manufacturing (JIT, aka Pull System), considered the father of the <em>Toyota Production System</em>.</p>
<p>The Seven Wastes are:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Delay, waiting or time spent in a queue with no value being added</em>.</li>
<li><em>Producing more than we need</em>.</li>
<li><em>Over processing or undertaking non-value added activity</em>.</li>
<li><em>Transportation</em>.</li>
<li><em>Unnecessary movement or motion</em>.</li>
<li><em>Inventory</em>.</li>
<li><em>Defects in the product</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also the &quot;Eight Wastes&quot; model, which includes the <em>human potential</em>, especially when used in a wrong way or in a non-value adding activity.</p>
