      <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
<p>Unit testing is an approach that <strong>prevents the release of code that contains bugs</strong>. Typically run locally as part of engineering workflows to provide feedback before a commit is made and any change is sent into the repository's mainline branch.</p>
<p>This technique involves breaking software components into smaller, isolated code blocks called units to be tested. <em>A unit has no external dependencies</em>. The tests consist of code that exercises a given unit with different inputs.</p>
<h3>Writing effective Unit Tests</h3>
<p>A unit test needs to be fast and <strong>hermetic</strong> at all, that means it should repeatedly <em>produce the same results</em> given the same inputs in the same environment, if not, it's not a reliable test. As expected, the efficiency and comprehensiveness of unit tests can significantly impact the robustness of the software.</p>
<p>It's useful to execute the same test with <em>different inputs</em>. Thereby minimizing the amount of: duplicated code; boilerplate code; and refactoring efforts.</p>
<h3>When to Write Unit Tests</h3>
<p>A common strategy is to write tests <strong>immediately after the code</strong>. These tests typically accompany the new code in the same commit. In organizations that practice code review, a peer reviewer can <em>double-check the tests</em> to ensure they're sufficiently robust to maintain the quality of the codebase.</p>
<p>Instead of writing tests after the code, we can <em>write tests before writing code</em> following <em>test-driven development</em> (TDD) methodologies, these tests are based on requirements and expected behaviors.</p>
<p>We can also <em>write tests in response to</em>: manual testing; code review efforts; during a milestone; and to verify that a proposed bug fix works, so later refactoring won't reintroduce the same bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the interest of covering as many scenarios as possible, you'll spend more time writing tests than writing the code being tested, especially when dealing with nontrivial systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How Unit Testing Affects Code</h3>
<p>To improve the comprehensiveness of tests, we may need to design new code to <em>include testing</em> provisions, or refactor older code to make it <em>more testable</em>. Refactoring involves providing a way to <strong>intercept calls</strong> (e.g.: to verify that the code invokes the interceptor the correct number of times, or with the correct arguments).</p>
<p>We should <em>remove direct calls</em> and replace them with <strong>abstractions</strong>. This dramatically reduces the &quot;flakiness&quot; of a test that depends on real-word systems, as tests will guarantee that we won't get random failures because of external dependencies, or even worse, unavailable systems (e.g: when consuming APIs).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These abstractions and their corresponding implementations are called <em>mocks</em>, <em>stubs</em>, or <em>fakes</em>. Engineers sometimes use these words interchangeably, despite the fact that the concepts vary in implementation complexity and features, so it's important to ensure everyone at the organization uses consistent vocabulary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another fact to keep in mind is that, if we have to completely rewrite the tests every time a method changes, we may need to rethink the tests or even the architecture of the system itself.</p>
