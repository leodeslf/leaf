<h3>Principles</h3>
<h4>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)</h4>
<p>Design, develop, test, maintenance, and reusability will be easier by having a <strong>single source of code</strong>, then reuse it and modify it in another place as needed.</p>
<p>Opposite to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy And Paste Programming, <strong>CAPP</strong>.</li>
<li>Clone And Modify Programming, <strong>CAMP</strong>.</li>
<li>Write Everything Twice, <strong>WET</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pragmatic Programmer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Keep it Simple, Stupid! (KISS)</h4>
<p>Each method should solve <strong>only one</strong> problem. More problems, options, or conditions should be solved by another block of code to be easily maintained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. -Leonardo da Vinci</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less is more. -Mies Van Der Rohe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. -Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>SOLID</h4>
<p>Also known as class design principles.</p>
<h5>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h5>
<p>Similar to the goal of KISS, code that follows this principle is easy to understand, maintain, and modify. It's also similar to DRY if done correctly. The goal is to <strong>isolate</strong> requirements and functionality <strong>in one place</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A class should have only one responsibility. A class should have one, and only one reason to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h5>
<p>Scalability should always be present, but additional features should not make changes just for the sake of adaption or customization. If something is working and tested, it should be <strong>extended</strong> making use of inheritance or prototyping, <strong>not modified</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h5>
<p>A derived element should <em>be</em> it's base element and more. In other words, if S is a subtype of T, then any of type T may be substituted by any S. As a subtype should <strong>inherit</strong> it's parent requirements, and <strong>include additional features</strong> (not to replace).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Derived classes must be able to substitute for their base classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h5>
<p>The <strong>specific is better</strong>, easier to develop, test, and maintain, it respects the SRP and KISS principles. We prefer to use many specific and easy-to-use interfaces than a single and complex one. It's intended to <strong>keep a system decoupled</strong> and thus easier to use and maintain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h5>
<p>Make your modules to <strong>depend on abstractions</strong>/interfaces, <strong>not in details</strong> of concrete implementation. Also, high-level modules should not depend on low-level ones, and both should depend on abstractions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Extreme Programming (XP)</h4>
<h5>You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)</h5>
<p>Only implement things when you <strong>need</strong> them, don't do them because you <em>think</em> you are gonna need it later.</p>
<h5>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work (DTSTTCPW)</h5>
<p>Prioritize requirements and <strong>do only the important</strong> things. Don't do things you don't need, don't improve things if not needed.</p>
<h4>MoSCoW</h4>
<p>A <strong>prioritization method</strong> to reach a common understanding of the <em>importance</em> of each requirement among a team. Developed by Dai Clegg in 1994.</p>
<h5>Must have</h5>
<p>They are <strong>critical</strong> for the current release to be delivered. If a requirements like this is not included, the project should be considered a <em>failure</em>.</p>
<h5>Should have</h5>
<p>They are <strong>important</strong> but not necessary for the current release. They are just <em>not needed now</em>, or the requirement can be satisfied in another way.</p>
<h5>Could have</h5>
<p>They are <strong>desirable</strong> but not necessary. Taken as a  <em>suggestion to improve</em> the product for a low cost in development. These are included if there is enough time.</p>
<h5>Won't have</h5>
<p>They are least-critical and <strong>not planned</strong> for the current release. In general they are either <em>reconsidered</em> for a future release or <em>dropped</em> at all.</p>
<h4>Worth mentioning</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>If it ain't broke, don't fix it</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Measure twice, cut once</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Occam's Razor</strong> (less dependencies are better).</li>
<li><strong>Law of Demeter</strong> (only talk to your friends).</li>
<li><strong>Big Design Up Front</strong> (BDUF).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Premature Optimization</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> (MVP).</li>
</ul>
