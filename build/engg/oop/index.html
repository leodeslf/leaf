      <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Simula</em> was the first OOL, developed in the 60s in Norway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>OOP Principles</h3>
<h4>Abstraction</h4>
<p>It is <strong>the pure concept of a requirement</strong>, it does not rely on concrete implementation details. We use it to define <em>what we need the software to do</em>, only then, based on that definition, we think about how will it do it.</p>
<h4>Encapsulation</h4>
<p>It is <strong>to hide implementation details</strong> (data or function members) that don't need to be visible from the outside (from any other object or non-object peace of software), thus we gain <em>control over what can be accessed or not</em>, and, at the same time, we <em>avoid name collision</em> between different interfaces.</p>
<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p>It is <strong>to reuse data and function members</strong> from a base implementation (a superclass) to a derived implementation (a subclass). That way we <em>save time</em> from developing and testing while still being able to <em>make modifications</em> to inherited members.</p>
<h4>Polymorphism</h4>
<p>It is <strong>the ability for an interface to change its value</strong> (data or function value) while <em>keeping the same name</em>, as well as being able to <em>exist in several objects</em>, so each object will process the same message in a different manner.</p>
<h3>OOP Design Principles</h3>
<h4>SOLID</h4>
<h5>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>A class should have only one responsibility. A class should have one, and only one reason to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to the goal of KISS, code that follows this principle is easy to understand, maintain, and modify. It's also similar to DRY if done correctly. The goal is to <strong>isolate</strong> requirements and functionality <strong>in one place</strong>.</p>
<h5>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scalability should always be present, but additional features should not make changes just for the sake of adaption or customization. If something is working and tested, it should be <strong>extended</strong> making use of inheritance or prototyping, <strong>not modified</strong>.</p>
<h5>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Derived classes must be able to substitute for their base classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A derived element should <em>be</em> its base element and more. In other words, if S is a subtype of T, then any of type T may be substituted by any S. A subtype should <strong>inherit</strong> its parent requirements and <strong>include additional features</strong> (not to replace them).</p>
<h5>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>specific is better</strong>, easier to develop, test, and maintain, and it respects the SRP and KISS principles. We prefer to use many specific and easy-to-use interfaces than a single and complex one. It's intended to <strong>keep a system decoupled</strong> and thus easier to use and maintain.</p>
<h5>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make your modules to <strong>depend on abstractions</strong>/interfaces, <strong>not in details</strong> of concrete implementation. Also, high-level modules should not depend on low-level ones, and both should depend on abstractions.</p>
