      <h2>Scrum Guide</h2>
<p>An <strong>Agile</strong> framework based on sprint iterations.</p>
<h3>Scrum Values</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commitment</strong>: The Scrum Team commits to <em>achieving its goals</em> and to <em>supporting each other</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to <em>make the best possible progress</em> toward these goals.</li>
<li><strong>Openness</strong>: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are <em>open about the work and the challenges</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Respect</strong>: Scrum <em>Team members respect each other</em> to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.</li>
<li><strong>Courage</strong>: The Scrum Team members have the courage to <em>do the right thing</em>, to <em>work on tough problems</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scrum Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Important decisions must be <em>visible to all the team all the time</em> and be based on the three artifacts. It enables inspection otherwise it is misleading and wasteful.</li>
<li><strong>Inspection</strong>: The three artifacts and progress must be <em>inspected frequently and diligently</em> to detect potential problems. It's pointless to inspect without adaptation. Scrum is designed to provoke change.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation</strong>: If any aspect of a process is unacceptable, the process or the product must be <em>adjusted as soon as possible</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scrum Team</h3>
<p>It consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. There are no sub-teams or hierarchies. If the Scrum Master or Product Owner are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.</p>
<p>The Scrum Team is <strong>cross-functional</strong> and <strong>self-managing</strong>. It is focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.</p>
<p>Typically <em>10 or fewer people</em>. Smaller teams tend to communicate better and to be more productive.</p>
<h4>Developers</h4>
<p>They are committed to <strong>creating</strong> any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint.</p>
<p>They create the plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog, adapting that plan every day defining what is done, and holding each other as professionals.</p>
<h4>Product Owner</h4>
<p>The person who ensures the right features make into the Product Backlog and maximize its value for each Sprint, <strong>representing the customers</strong> of the product.</p>
<p>Responsible for the <em>Product Backlog management</em>, developing and comminicating its items and the whole Product Goal, ordering and keeping it transparent, visible, and understandable.</p>
<h4>Scrum Master</h4>
<p>Is who makes sure the project is progressing smoothly, and any member of the team has the tools they need to get their job done. Sets up meetings, <strong>monitors</strong> the working being done and <strong>facilitates</strong> release planning.</p>
<p>Helps the Product Owner with techniques for the Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management.</p>
<p>Also serves the organization by <em>leading</em>, <em>training</em>, and <em>coaching</em> to understand the Scrum theory and practice, both the Scrum Team and the organization.</p>
<h3>Scrum Events</h3>
<p>Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to <strong>inspect and adapt</strong> Scrum artifacts.</p>
<h4>The Sprint</h4>
<p>They are fixed length events of <em>one month or less</em>. A new Sprint starts immediately after the previous Sprint.</p>
<p>All the work necessary to <em>achieve the Product Goal</em>, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.</p>
<p>During the Sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal.</li>
<li>Quality does not decrease.</li>
<li>The Product Backlog is refined as needed.</li>
<li>Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Sprint may be considered a short project.</p>
<p>Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint.</p>
<h4>Sprint Planning</h4>
<p>Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of <em>eight hours</em>.</p>
<p>It <em>initiates the Sprint</em> by laying out the work to be performed. The resulting plan is created by the entire Scrum Team and even other people invited to provide advice.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning topics:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is this Sprint valuable?</strong> Here the Sprint Goal must be finalized to define the plan relative to it.</li>
<li><strong>What can be Done this Sprint?</strong> Developers and the Product Owner select items from the Products Backlog to include in the current Sprint.</li>
<li><strong>How will the chosen work get done?</strong> Developers and the Product Backlog plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Daily Scrum</h4>
<p>It's a <em>15-minute</em> event for Developers to <em>inspect and adapt</em> the Sprint Backlog as necessary. Each Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place <em>every working day</em>. It produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.</p>
<p>Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.</p>
<h4>Sprint Review</h4>
<p>Sprint Review's purpose is to <em>inspect the outcome of the Sprint</em> and determine future adaptations.</p>
<p>During the event, the Scrum Team presents the <em>results</em> of their work to key stakeholders, all of them review what was accomplished and what has changed in their environment. The product Backlog may be adjusted.</p>
<p>It's the second to last event, and it's timeboxed to a maximum of <em>four hours</em>.</p>
<h4>Sprint Retrospective</h4>
<p>The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to <em>increase quality and effectiveness</em>.</p>
<p>The Scrum Team inspects <em>how the last Sprint went</em> with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work.</p>
<p>The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It's timeboxed to a maximum of <em>three hours</em>.</p>
<h3>Scrum Artifacts</h3>
<p>Scrum's artifacts represent <strong>work or value</strong>. They are designed to <em>maximize transparency</em>, thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.</p>
<p>Each artifact contains a <em>commitment</em> to ensure it provides information against which progress can be measured:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.</li>
<li>For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.</li>
<li>For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Product Backlog</h4>
<p>It's a <strong>list of what is needed</strong> to improve the product. It's the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.</p>
<p>Items from it that can be Done within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They acquire this level of transparency after refining activities. Refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as description, order, size, etc.</p>
<p>The Developers are responsible for the sizing.</p>
<p>The Product Owner may influence by helping understand and select trade-offs.</p>
<h5>Commitment: Product Goal</h5>
<p>It describes a <em>future state of the product</em>, it is in the Product Backlog, the rest of the Product Backlog items emerge to define &quot;what&quot; will fulfill the Product Goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Product Goal is the <em>long-term objective</em> for the Scrum Team.</p>
<h4>Sprint Backlog</h4>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is a <strong>plan to accomplish the Sprint</strong>, made by and for the Developers to have a visible and real-time picture of the work progress. It's composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for that Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).</p>
<h5>Commitment: Sprint Goal</h5>
<p>It's the <em>single objective</em> for the Sprint. It creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.</p>
<p>The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.</p>
<p>If the work turns out to be different than the expected, the Developers collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.</p>
<h4>Increment</h4>
<p>An Increment is a <strong>concrete stepping stone</strong> toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior ones, the results are verified and working together, the sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint.</p>
<p>Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.</p>
<h5>Commitment: Definition of Done</h5>
<p>It's a <em>formal description of the state</em> of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.</p>
<p>It creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment.</p>
