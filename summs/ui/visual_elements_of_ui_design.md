# Visual Elements of User Interface Design

**UI / UX Design Specialization** by California Insitute of Arts (CalArts) at Cursera (1/4).

## What is a User Interface

It's the _bridge_ between user and content.

## The Relationship between UI and UX

UI:

- How it looks / **Visual design**.
- Form, aesthetics, look & feel, organization.
- Design driven.

UX:

- How it feels / **Non-visual design**.
- Feel, navigation, story, structure.
- User driven.

## A Brief Historical Overview of Interface Design

We need to have _feedback_, know when the interface is working or not, know if we make a mistake or it is all right, be able to undo and redo our actions.

## Interface Conventions: Theory

An interface should be based on:

- Real world knowledge (analog models).
- Learned behaviour (conventions).
- Cause and effect (action / reaction).
- Consistency (logical / systematic).
- Seamless (speed and ease).
- Immediate intuition (a few teach a lot).
- Fulfillment (payoff / results).
- Undo / redo / confirm (feel safe).

## Template vs Content

The right interface is based on _content_, _context_ and _functionality_ for a specific _audience_.

Generic templates can work for some UI elements or components. Not for an entire interface. That leads us to a _generic experience_ (a poor experience).

## Aesthetics & Functionality

Aesthetics and functionality are different things, but, UI should always be related and familiar to the functionality.

Relationship is making it easy to know **how it works** by **how it looks**.

## Design Before Design

Project Brief (how it all starts):

- What is it?
- Who is it for?
- Where does it live?

It is the **non-visual pre-design**.

Client determines and must be clear about:

- Goals.
- Constraints.
- Platform.
- Audience.

## Look and Feel

Defining **style** and **mood** helps to envision the overall design (pre-design).

Look and feel defines:

- Mood.
- Typography.
- Color palette.
- Language.

## Language as a design tool

Language sets mood and tone.

We need to define **naming** and **branding** for the UI by specifying the audience, their _attitude_ and _motivation_ to use the app / web.

## Color & Shape

Use color and shape to define _association_, _functionality_ and _state_ of UI elements. That lets the user know if an element is disabled, active or inactive.

## Imagery

**Imagery as content**: Can be videos, search engines and all images _in boxes_.

A special case is the **immersive imagery**. It is used for games, apps and animations. By its own, they create the context, a whole world / universe for the product, where things don't have to _live in boxes_ anymore.

**Imagery as navigation**: They are icons, symbols and links to some other content or functionality.

**Imagery as mood**: They contribute to the look and feel, can be a part of the content or the navigation.

## Typography

Type is language made physical, is fast, is accurate and clear meaning, is economical, and can represent what cannot be depicted.

**Type as content**: Typographic material, articles, blogs, books, etc.

**Type as interface**: Labels, buttons and navigation.

**Type as branding**: The app or site identity.

## Icons

**Icon**: Pictorial representation (realistic / descriptive). We use to _know_ what an icon _is_.

**Symbol**: Non-pictorial representation (abstract). We use to _learn_ what a symbol _means_.

Sometimes a single image can act as both an icon and a symbol.

What makes a good icon?

- Communication (ideas + aesthetics).
- Functionality (technical).
- Audience (use gets it!).
- Recognition (saturation + simplicity).

## Functionality

Creating a logical UI is creating a **predictable system**.

A UI must combine **logic**, **hierarchy** and **systematic** behaviours. While using the **intuition**, **discovery** and **learning**.

These facts help the user to interact fast and easily, as we make an economic interface. Economizing UI elements and user actions, saving time and doing more with less.

## Speed and Style

Speed:

✔ Simple / direct  
✔ Unambiguous  
✔ Rapidly adoptable  
✔ Familiar / predictable  
✔ Logical  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring  
❌ Boring

Style:

✔ Entertaining  
✔ Engaging  
✔ Rewarding experience  
✔ Brandable  
✔ Novel / individual  
❌ Obstructs Content  
❌ Time-consuming  
❌ Frustrating experience  
❌ Dates rapidly  
❌ Unnecessary

## Composition and Structure

Content-specific design: Sometimes, the structure is all the content, and its functionality drives all the design decisions.

## Buttons

Size: Must be related to the size of the _cursor_, _finger_ and the _screen_.  
Shape: Meaningful for _functionality_, depending on its _label_ and the _screen_.  
Color: It can make it easy to recognise _what a button is made for_ (even without a label).  
Dimension: Making a button _similar_ to a real one, makes the UI intuitive.  
System: Buttons need to have a _logic placement_ on screen to make sense by themself.

## Not Buttons

Menus, links, fields. Use design conventions for these elements, for _shape_, _scale_, _contrast_, _clarity_ and _economy_, in order to reinforce and emphasize the goals of speed and function.

## States and Changes

Let the user know the UI element is responsive (is working) by adding visual states, _normal_, _hover_, _active_, _inactive_.

Think about the different static elements states as well as how your elements animate between states.

## Hierarchy of Content

Figure out _what goes where_, and _why_:

- **Function**, what's (and what's NOT) important to the user?
- **Intention**, what's (and what's NOT) important to the client?

It's critical to define **the scene**, **the thinking**, and **physical reaction** of the user:

- What's the first thing the user _sees_?
- What's the user's _first impression_?
- What's the first thing the user _does_?

## Conventions and Expectations

_Small screen: single task + multiple screens_.

By convention we focus on a single task when working on a small screen, even when multiple functions are available, we keep them hidden, until we need them.

_Big screen: multiple tasks + single screen_.

In this case, we can focus on multiple tasks on a single big screen as we have enough space to work.
