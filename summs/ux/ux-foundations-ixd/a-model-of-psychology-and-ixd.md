# A Model of Psychology and Interaction Design

## Why psychology?

Understading how people feel, think, understand the information, and make decisions, can help us generate better ideas and solutions and help us craft and deliver better experiences.

The core model is:

* Discover (study and insigts) [this course]
* Craft (design and prototype) [this course]
* Deliver (develop and measure)
* Improve (iterate and optimize)

### Discover

**Identify** (research about) the problem to be solved or need to be met.

By researching we need to:

* Measure (objective, quantitative data)
* Observe (subjective data that may be qualitative or quantitative)
* Ask (self-report data that may be qualitative or quantitative)

**Define**, describe the problem or need and the desired outcome or goal.

**Frame**, place the solution and outcome in the larger context of the person and the product or service.

### Craft

**Design** from an abducting reasoning, critical thinking, and problem-solving.

**Prototype**, evaluate if our design decisions are working, and identify alternatives if not.

**Iterate**, designing and prototyping are iterative processes, we generate, evaluate, and adjust ideas repeatedly to identify the best solution.

## Introducing the Interaction Design model

```txt
CONTEXT
└> GOALS
   ├> PRODUCTIVITY
   └> CREATIVITY & PLAY
      ├> PERCEPTION 
      ├> MOTIVATION
      ├> COGNITION
      └> EMOTION
         └> BEHAVIOR
```

## Context

Refers to the circumstances, situation and environment in with a person is interacting with a product.

* Who?
  * Description
  * Experience
  * Expectations
  * Individual or group
* When and Where?
  * Location
  * Time
  * Public vs private
  * Focus
* What and How?
  * Objects, devices, and tools
  * Purpose
  * Conjunction
  * Alternatives
  * Efficacy

## Goals

What the poeple is trying to achieve. The desired outcomes.

It's important to define the type of activity. Productivity vs Play, what we may feel obligated to perform, or may feel desire to engage in creative play (the "I need to" vs "I want to").

Describing the Goals and Desired Outcomes:

* Objectives
  * Outcomes
  * Achievements
  * End states
* Importance
  * Value
  * Essential/necessary
  * Optional/elective
* Urgency
  * Priority
  * Critical/compelling
  * Timing
