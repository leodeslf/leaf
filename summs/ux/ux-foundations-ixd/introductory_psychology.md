# Introductory Psychology (3/5)

## Sensation

Most important senses interaction focuses on are: vision, hearing, touch, and proprioception.

What the user sees and how, keeping in mind possible user visual deficiencies, what the user hears when something happens, nothing or some sound signals, how the user squeezes or drags an element, the device vibrates or not, how the elements on the UI are distributed and perceived.

## Perception

Is the fact of processing and recognizing the information we get through the senses.

Environmental conditions can change the way we perceive things, but we still manage to do that with great consistency due to the brain "magic".

Shape, lightness, color, distance, size, location, and timbre are some of these conditions.

## Gestalt principles

Starting in 1910, Max Wertheimer, a German psychologist, noticed that a series of blinking lights creates the illusion of motion. The *Phi Effect*.

* Gestalt means "shape and form".
* We perceive the world as meaningful and complete objects, not a series of independent parts.

### Gestalt Laws

* Figure-ground: how we organize our perceptions in terms of foreground objects, the clearly defined ones, and background objects, which may be unbounded or vaguely defined.
* Simplicity: how we organize our perceptions into the simplest possible experience.
* Proximity: objects near one to other in space or time, are perceived as being a group.
* Similarity: objects with similar characteristics, such as form, color, size, and brightness, are perceived as belonging together.
* Common fate: how objects moving together are perceived as belonging together.
* And others like closure, continuity, and symmetry.

## Affordances

* Physical characteristics of objects make possible what we are able to do.
* We recognize when we are able to interact.
* Affordances are relative to the individual and their ability to interact.

* It doesn't require conscious attention and thought.
* It arises from our intrinsic understanding of our physical relationship with the world around us.

Don Norman introduced the concept of the *perceived affordance*. When people perceive similarity between a digital representation and an actual physical object.

We might use common depth cues, like:

* Shadows
* Perspective
* Overlap / Layers
* Blur
* Scale

## Motivation

We need to understand both the user **goals** and **needs**. As we know what actually drives people to do things, we can describe context and goals more efficiently:

* People
* Situation
* Needs
* Objectives
* Importance
* Urgency

### Theories of Motivation

#### Locus of control

* External - Extrinsic motivation: when people behavior is influenced by external factors, usually things they **need / are obligated to**, or ends in rewards or earnings.
* Internal - Intrinsic motivation: when people do something because they **want to**, because it's personally rewarding.

#### David McClelland described motivation as

* Achievement: problem solving and learning.
* Affiliation: social relationships.
* Power: influencing others.

#### Victor Vroom - Expectancy theory

* Expectancy: "If I put forth the effort necessary, then I will perform well".
* Instrumentality: "If I perform well, then I will receive an outcome".
* Valence: "If I value the outcome, then I will be motivated to put forth the effort necessary".

#### ERG theory

* Existence: basic survival and safety.
* Relatedness: establishing and maintaining interpersonal relationships.
* Growth: intrinsic desire for personal development and self-esteem.

## Attention and Memory

### Attention

Attention is a limited resource, we cannot pay attention to everything, so we focus only on what we think is important.

As the designers, we need to provide **structure**, **hierarchy** and guide attention to what is truly important and necessary.

### Memory

* Our ability to store, recall, and recognize information.
* We expect it to work and only notice when it fails.
* We depend on our devices to store information for us to extend our memory.

#### Three stages of memory

##### Sonsory store

Very brief snapshot of incoming sensory information; most of it will be lost.

##### Working

Short-duration and limited capacity memory for active thinking and processing.

##### Long-term

Long duration and very large capacity, this is where we store information for future.

* Declarative:
  * Things we know (knowledge).
  * Semantic - facts.
  * Episodic - events.
  * Easy to state and describe information we know.
* Procedural
  * Things we can do (skills).
  * Easier to show how to perform an action or task than to describe how to do id.

### Encoding information

#### Schemas

Memory structures that organize information for meaning and associations.

#### Assimilation

New information similar to what we already know gets added to existing schema.

#### Accommodation

New information unlike anything we already know requires new schemas.

### How we retrieve information

#### Recall

What we usually think of as memory: we store information and retrieve it when we need it.

#### Recognition

It's making a selection from a set of choices by comparing what we perceive with what we remember.

### Recognition is easier than recall

* Show information and functionality when it is needed.
* Put information and functionality where people expect to find it.
* Present information in meaningful ways.

### Visual memory is powerful

* Memory for images is better than our memory for words.
* Images can represent complex concepts, easier and faster than words.

### Pattern recognition

The ability to see patterns and to make connections between similar and related things.

## Reasoning and logic

### Problem-solving

It's identifying a solution and defining the steps necessary to achieve it.

Methods:

* Trial-and-error
* Difference reduction (comparing)
* Subgoal decomposition
* Analogy
* Transformation
* Algorithms and heuristics

### Decision-making

It's making the best choice from a set of options for a given context or situation.

Methods:

* Rational
* Optimal
* Satisficing
* Pain vs Value

* Our knowledge, experience, understanding, and expectations all contribute to deciding what we will do.

## Mental Models

They are our **thoughts and expectations** about how things work in the real world. They influence our behavior, decisions, and attitudes.

### Concept formation

* Taking information, breaking it into meaningful pieces, and sorting them into general rules.
* Associations, schemas, and concepts come to form mental models.

### Types of Models

#### Mental model

Prior experiences and expectations of how a product should work in the user's mind.

#### Concept model

Prior experiences, plans, and design intents for how a product should work in the creator's mind.

#### System model

How the product actually works.

### Good mental models simplify

* Exposing the system nearly always complicates the product experience.
* We must understand how something really works (system model) so that we can design a product (concept model) that is easy for the people to understand and use (mental model).

## The effort of thinking

### Cognitive Load

It refers to how much effort we put into understanding information, making decisions, and solving problems.

### Cognitive Friction

It occurs when people have to put in more than they should and are therefore slowed down.

### Information overload

* Attention and working memory are limited.
* Exceeding our cognitive capacity can loea to forgetting, misunderstanding, and confusion.
* Products should do as much of the work as possible for the people who use them.

**Not all cognitive load is bad**, but it can cause cognitive friction.

### Reducing Cognitive Load

* Base smart defaults on context, usage patterns, and past behavior.
* Only use smart defaults when they are likely to be correct.
* Make smart defaults easy to change.

### Reducing Cognitive Friction

* Understand the mental models.
* Provide meaningful information.
* Keep people focused on the outcome or goal.
* Simplify the interactions.
* Provide help and instructions.

## Theories of Emotion

Emotions are subjective and difficult to define and measure, they may vary by individual context. The absence of negative experiences is not enough to create positive emotions.

### Designing for positive experiences

Increase the **frequency** and **duration** if positive emotional experiences. Decrease or avoid the negative emotional experiences.

### Classifying emotions

**Paul Ekman** classifies by six basic and universal emotions:

* Anger
* Disgust
* Fear
* Sadness
* Happiness
* Surprise

## Designing for delight

**Surprise only works once**.

A continuous stream of surprising new things is unsustainable.

### Levels of Delight (Tollady and Rowe)

* Surface delight comes from the characteristics of the product we perceive and experience.
* Deep delight emerges when products are frictionless, effortless, easy, and meaningful.
* Strive to create products that are deeply delightful.

### Creating Delight (Dana Chisnell)

* Pleasure arises from humor, uniqueness, personality, beauty, simplicity, and the ability to anticipate needs.
* Flow arises from ease of use, efficiency, immersiveness, automation, and when people feel empowered.
* Meaning creates delight with purpose, value, connectedness, relevance, and personal engagement with compassion and care.

### Hierarchy of product quality (Aaron Walter)

* Functional
* Reliable & Dependable
* Ease of Use
* Pleasurable (Delight)

Making something **functional and reliable is not enough** to be "ready to use". We should think about it's ease of use and the rewarding/pleasurable part before launching it.

### Incorporating Delight

* Delight is many things, and **it must be part of the design process**.
* It cannot be added at the end.
* Delight (and positive emotional experiences in general) should be on par with functionality, reliability, and usability.

## Empathy

> "Empathy is the ability to understand and identify with another person's context, emotions, goals, and motivations." - Whitney Quesemberry

### You are not designing for yourself

* Do not assume that people have the same needs or will use a product the same way we would.
* We know much more about the product, the technology, and the business needs, therefore we are biased.
* It is easy to fall into the trap of designing for ourselves.

### Fostering Empathy

* Spend time with the people who use your product.
* Develop good listening and observation skills.
* Collect objective data about how your product is actually being used.
* Remove yourself from the product decisions.
* Practice with colleagues and help each other improve.
* Employ user-centered design methods.

## Learning Behaviors

### Behavior and Interaction Design

* Focus and the signals and cues that indicate certain behaviors may be performed.
* Internal states, motivations, and emotions are difficult to detect and measure, so we observe behavior to try to understand needs and goals.

### Multiple Theories of Behavior

* We'll focus on behaviorist theories, because interactions are observable and measurable.
* These theories can provide models for predicting what people may do and why they interact with a product.

### Basic Terminology

* **Stimulus** is a signal.
* **Response** is a behavior.
* **Consequence** is an outcome.
* **Conditioning** is learning.
* **Association** is connecting.

### Three Theories of Learned Behavior

**Classical conditioning**: we learn to associate experiences that occur together in space and/or time.
**Operant (or Instrumental) conditioning**: we learn to behave to seek reward and avoid punishment.
**Observational (or Social) learning**: we learn by observing others then imitating them.

## Classical Conditioning

* Start with a behavior that already occurs in response to a signal.
* Pair a new signal with the existing signal.
* Over time and with repeated experience, the new signal becomes associated with the original signal, and the new signal elicits the same behavior.

### Conditional Emotional Responses

* Some emotional reactions are learned responses to neutral signals. These are called Conditional Emotional Responses.
* Neutral signals paired with stimuli that cause an emotion can elicit that emotion once the neutral signal and original stimulus are associated.

## Operant Conditioning

* A stimulus (or signal) indicates that a behavior may be performed.
* Once the behavior is performed, an outcome (or consequence) results.

### Reinforcement vs Punishment

* Outcomes that are good, desirable, and rewarding reinforce the behavior and increase the frequency of that behavior.
* Outcomes that are bar or undesirable punish the behavior and decrease the frequency of that behavior.

### Frequency of Reinforcement

* New behaviors can be learned quickly if they are reinforced immediately after every occurence.
* In real life, most reinforcement is not this predictable and consistent.
* Reinforcement is still effective even if it is not delivered for every behavior.

Reinforcement can be scheduled as something happens certain **amount of times** or the **amount of time** since the last time something happens.

I.e.:

Reinforce some behavior every ten times it occurs, or about two hours since the last time behavior has been reinforced.

### Rewards have different values

* Nor all rewards have the same value for everyone.
* What reinforces behavior in one person may not reinforce the same behavior in another.

#### Selecting Rewards

* Attention, recognition, and praise are social reinforcers.
* Money, credits, and points are financial reinforcers.

### Extinction

* Behaviors which are no longer reinforced then fade.
* The more frequent and regular the reinforcement, the faster the behavior will fade when reinforcement is withdrawn.

## Social Learning Theory

For Albert Bandura, **Learning**:

* Is a cognitive process
* Occurs in social context.
* May occur even without performing the behaviors or being directly reinforced.

In addition to behaviors, **we also learn values and attitudes**.

### Modeling and Imitation

* When we observe other people behaving, they serve as models that we can then imitate.
* Seeing other people being reinforced makes us more likely to perform that behavior.
* Seeing other people being punished makes us less likely to perform that behavior.

### Learning behavior is an active process

* We may learn from watching others or the environment around us and not show any changes in behavior.
* Observation, cognition, and context all influence what we learn and when we choose to exhibit a behavior.

### Three Types of Modeling (Bandura)

* **Live models**: *a person demonstrates* the desired behavior, we observe directly, then we imitate their behavior.
* **Direct instruction**: *a person describes* the desired behavior in detail and provides instructions to us about how to do it, then we perform the behavior as described.
* **Symbolic instruction**: *modeling occurs through media*, webs, written and/or illustrated information, video, and audio. We view the media then perform the behavior as instructed.

## Using learned behavior

### Past experiences influence future behavior

* What we learned in the past influences how we behave now and how we might behave in the future.
* We look for ways to apply what we already know to new situations.
* Transfer refers to our ability to take information and behaviors learned in one context and apply it in another.

### Generalization

* We generalize our past experiences and transfer what we have learned to similar situations.
* If it even remotely looks like something we have done before, we will interact with it using those behaviors.
* When experiences are identifiably analogous, people will generalize and transfer their knowledge more efficiently.
* The less similar the situation appears, the more cognitive effort it takes to determine if a past learned behavior is relevant and should be applied.
* Facilitate generalization by making it easier for people to identify analogous situations.

### Discrimination learning

* People also learn how to distinguish among situations or problems that may appear similar but are actually different.
* Do not design a product that misleads people to predict it operates in a way it does not, or makes it look non-interactive.
