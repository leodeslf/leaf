# The Interaction Design Model

The behavior on the [interaction design model](a-model-of-psychology-and-ixd.md/#introducing-the-interaction-design-model) is the actual interaction with the product, and it has its own cycle.

## Percieve

People are less likely to interact if they do not perceive the opportunity to interact, even if they need or want to interact.

> People must understand there are things they can do.

Good design solutions **increase the perceivability** of opportunities to interact as well as **inform people** about the appropriate or correct ways to interact.

> We bring our past experiences and learning to every new experience.

### Perceivability

* More than just a visual signal and cues.
* **All content and interactions must be accessible for all people**.
* Gestures and voice interaction often lack perceivable signals and cues, so people often do not know what they can do or say

### Multiple possible interactions

* MAny products offer many functions and services, but ussually need only one a few per use.
* We quickly process our options and select the most salient and relevant, and then ignore the rest.

## Predict

### Confidence

If people are confident that their interaction with a product will help them achieve their goals, then the probability of intraction increases.

### Deciding among options

When there are different ways to complete a task, people decide based on:

* Context
* Goal
* Prior experience
* Perveivability
* Confidence

## Feedback

### Three stages of feedback

#### Interaction acknowledged

An immediate response to a person's interaction and request. The product acknowledges that they have done something.

Techniques:

* Hovers, rollovers, and down states.
* Transitions for size, rotation, and location.
* Modal layers and dialogs appear or disappear.
* Sound and vibration.

#### Request in progress

Interim feedback to indicate that the product is still working on the request and provides progress information.

Techniques:

* De-activate states with status messages.
* Progress indicators fot time, amount, or simply ongoing.

#### Results of interaction

The final feedback is the actual result or output of the product in response to a person's request.

Final feedback forms and variations:

* Navigate to a new page or screen.
* Modal layers and dialogs.
* Update content on the current page.
* Control media playback.
* Control game play.
* Error message.

### Ambient feedback

* Subtle, continuous change to the interface that provide useful information at a glance.
* It usually conveys information about a single variable in a simple way.

### Anticipatory feedback

* Information is provided before a person interacts to help them understate what the outcomes may be.
* Improves the accuracy of predictions.
* Helps people avoid interactions that are not likely to help them achieve their goals.

### Making meaning of feedback

* We put cognitive effort into making sense of feedback
* Is the outcome meaningful?
* Does the outcome match the prediction?
* Does the outcome help the person get closer to the goal?

### Value of outcomes

* Meaningful outcomes that match predictions and move people toward their goals are more useful and valuable.
* The probability of continued interaction with the product increases.

### Feedback bring emotions

Useful outcomes and meaningful feedback create positive experiences, instill trust, and may even delight people.

## Learn

### Practice to learn

* We observe our own behavior and the outcomes that occur.
* Repeated interactions strengthen then associations and improve the accuracy of predictions.
* The more we practice, the faster and more accurate our interactions with the product become.

### Intuitive Design

Even when when products are "intuitive", they may require multiple uses and practice before people learn and remember how to interact.

## Remember

### Memory and remembering

* **Sensory Store**: during the perceive phase we process all incoming information and indentify the important elements.
* **Working Memory**: during the feedback and learn phases we process information for meaning and associations.
* **Long-term Memory**: during the remember phase we store learned information (and skills) for future use.

### Transfer

* We recognize products we have used before, may remember how to use them, and recall and ew-use what we learned.
* We notice similarities between prior experiences and new products, transfer what we learned from earlier product experiences, and apply those skills and knowledge to the new prducts.

Sometimes, we can mismatch, confuse, or even forget what we have learned.
