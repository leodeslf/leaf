# Interaction Design

Can be approached as:

* **Dimensions** of focus
* **Models** of methods and processes
* Guiding **principles**

## Five Dimensions of IxD

By Gillian Crampton Smith and Kevin Silver.

* **Words** (content): should be easy to understand and written to effectively communicate information.
* **Visual representations**: diagrams, illustrations, graphics, and even typographic styles and media to clarify data and concepts.
* **Physical objects or space**: physical hardware, such as keyboard, mouse, or smartphone, and the space necessary to use it effectively.
* **Time**: the time during which people interact with the product and how they might measure their progress.
* **Behavior**: actions, reactions, and emotions people have when interacting with a product.

## Design Thinking

Exploratory and iterative methods are effective when we are facing problems that are vague or not understood.

We need to:

* Understand people and problems.
* Change assumptions.
* Generate solutions.

Different methods helps us to:

* **Diverge**: is the process of generating multiple ideas.
* **Converge**: is the process of choosing the best of those ideas.

### Design Thinking mehtods

1. Observe and empathize.
1. Explore and create.
1. Build and deliver.
1. Iterate and improve.

### Double Diamond

Solution --> Develop --> Deliver
```

### Core Design Principles

1. Understand people and their context.
1. Define a product's purpose based on people's needs and goals.
1. Craft experiences for efficient flow.
1. Deliver meaningful, relevant, and valuable experiences.
1. Ensure products easy to use, learn, and remember.
1. Always respect and protect the people who use our products and sercives.

## Levels of design

### Structure

It focus on the overall oreganization and architecture of the product. We identify and define the systematic structire of content and functionality.

#### Scent of Information

It's derived from informatioon foraging theory, this is how people can *predict* what they will find if they follow a path or flow through a product.

#### Three levels of Structure

* **Product**: overall architecture defines all of their sections, the purpouse of each, and the navigation and connections among them.
* **Screen**: what belongs on each page or screen and where should it appear? What appears on all multiple screens? Placement can communicate importance, relationships, and functionality.
* **Component**: define the content and interactivity of individual elements on the screen. We are not yet focused on final appearance, because we first need to validate that the structure and flow are correct.

### Flow

Here we identify and define all of the sreps people must take and the states of the product as they work toward their goal.

#### Three levels of Flow

* **Multi-channel ecosystem**: many products and services are used in conjunction with others. How does the product fit into a larger ecosystem? What are the paths though the product and the states of the product.
* **Product**: indentify the paths through the product and all of the steps and actions necessary to complete tasks. There is at least one path for each function. There may be more than one path to achieve the same goal.
* **Components**: identify abd describe the various states if interactivity screens and components. Define the conditions that produce each and the outcomes that may result.

#### Simple flows

Simple tasks tend to be brief, direct, and linear.

#### Complex flows

Complex tasks tend to have multiple decision points, branching, and repeat actions, and have multiple states contingent upon context and prior interactions or choices.

#### Nested flows

* Flows may also be nested within other flows.
* There may be sub-steps, multiple paths, interactions across products and channels, and multi-session interactions.
* Design to effectively communicate place, state, and progress.

### Interface

At this level, we focus on appearance and behavior, but this is also the stage where we add the polish, nuance, and refinement that can differentiate a product.

#### More than Brand and Identity

Appearance and behavior can:

* Clarify structure and flow.
* Clarify and enhance content
* Guide through a path
* Enhance feedback
* Help people identify opportunities to transfer and apply their prior experiences.

#### Appearance, Meaning, and value

* Good design enhances the value and quality of a product.
* Bad design detracts from or even interferes with a product experience.
* Prople judge the quality of a product higher and think it works better when it is attractive.

## Patterns

### Design patterns

Design patterns are recurring, re-usable, **optimal solutions** to common design problems.

There are DP for structure, flow, and interface.

Good DP are:

* Familiar, recognizable, and easy to apply correctly.
* Optimal, effective, and efficient.
* Relevant in the context and to the goals.
* Effortless and easy to use with minimal work.

> Good design patterns improve consistency and cohesivness, whith makes producs easier to use, learn, and remember.

### Anti-patterns

Anti-patterns are recurring solutions that may be common and familiar, but they are **non-optimal** in practice.

They are non-optimal, but, it doesn't mean they are bad or worst than a pattern. They are just exceptions.

### Dark patterns

Dark patterns **intentionally mislead people** into making choices and performing actions they would not have otherwise chosen to do and which are not in their best interests.

Harry Brignull studied and identified multiple types of dark patterns, such as:

* Bait and switch
* Disguised ads
* Forced continuity
* Friend spam
* Hidden costs
* Misdirection
* Price comparison prevention
* Privacy Zuckering
* Roach motel
* Sneak into basket
* Trick questions

Dark patterns are associated with **violations of privacy**, **theft of money and information**, and the **installation of malware**.

*Features* that can counter a dark pattern from a product:

* Perceivable / Findable.
* Honest / Transparent.
* Notify / Clarify.
* Comparison / Confirmation.
* Reversible / Usable.

## Navigation

Navigation is the movement from place to place or state to state within a product.

### Navigation structure

Information architecture:

* Information architecture as a field and practice is attributed to Richard Saul Wurman.
* It is typically incolved in creating the structire of a navigation system.
* Good information architecture is often considered essential for good interaction design.

Mental models we have about:

* How information should be organized.
* Flows and the sequence of steps is will take to perform an action.
* Tasks organized into a logical sequence of steps (that will be easier to complete).

### Navigation systems

Types of navogation systems:

* **Hierarchical**: used when there are multiple levels, or hierarchies, in the structure of the content and functionality.
* **Hub and spoke**: there is a central hub from which to explore and browse. There are often several independent sections, and each may have different content or functions.
* **Adaptive**: navigation adjusts dynamically to the context, content, and how it is being used.
  * Inditivual access privileges.
  * Suggested actions based on context.
  * Valid actions based on section or content.
* **Steam**: used when there is a steady stream of new content or posts, presented in reverse chronological order, may be algorithms to promote sponsored or popular content.
* **Search sort, and filter**: effective when there are vast amounts of content, whether or not it is well-organized.
* **Interactive or gestural**: used when navigation elements are revealed after an interaction, often lack signals or cues, so they may be difficult to discover. We shall use hints and cues to indicate that actions are available.
* **Content link**: links in the content of a page or screen are a form of contextually relevant navigation.
* **Hybrid**: when mixing different types of navigation into a single system.

#### Findability vs Discoverability

*Findability* is when a person **knows in advance** that something is or should be within the product. **Discoverability** is when a person **does not know in advance** that something exists and is available within that product.

## Content

### Content strategy

* It guides the creation, publication, and maintenance of meaningful, relevant content.
* Content creation is an essential part of the design process.
* Content takes many form.

### Design with text

* **Readability**: is the ease with which a reader can understand weitten text. We need to use *appropriate vocabulary* and syntax based on context of the product.
* **Scanning**: organize text to facilitate scanning to *help people focus* their attention and fin what they need.
* **Typography**: optimize fint size, line height, and line lenght. Also text styles are used to differentiate among text types, headers, labels, body content, and links.
* **Interactivity**: expose only the necessary information to *keep the product focused and simpler*. Extencive content may benefit from interactive layouts that conceal and reveal supplemental information as needed.

### Microcopy

Small pieces of text found throughout the interface, important for clarity and guidance. Such as buttons, labels, status and progress indicators.

### Localization

* Language.
* Numeric, date, and time formats.
* Use of currency.
* Keyboard usage.
* Collation and sorting.
* Symbols, icons, and colors.
* Culturally appropiate text and graphics.
* Varyng legal requirements, among others.

### Imagery

* Images have high information density. They can convey much in a small amount of space.
* Enable pan and zoom for exploration of large, highly detailed images.

### Interactive images and media

* Highly interactive content experiences can be very engaging.
* Interactions should support and enhance the information and improve comprehension.
* Design interacive media with the same principles used to design products.

### Media controls

* Auto-play should be used only when requested and expected.
* When not requested, auto-play distracts and interrupts.
* Removing control over auto-playing media is an undesirable and negative experience.

## Inputs

### Bi-directional data flow

* Interaction is bi-directional. People add and receive information.
* Data can be entered many ways through input devices and sensors.
* Data may be gathered without explicit interaction. (Such as GPS location or ambient brightness).

### Interaction gap

* The more distance or time between the point of interaction and the result or reaction, the more difficult it may be to control.
* Experiences where people "interacti here for outcomes over thre" may be more dificult to predict and learn.

### Direct interaction

* It's easier to learn, control, and predict.
* Strive to make interactions as direct and immediate as possible.

### Keyboards

* Typing has been around for 150 years and os a familiar interaction.
* On-screen keyboards replicate the familiar od layout of keys, but the interactions are more direct, because the interaction gap is reduced.

### Mice and trackballs

* Distance from and orientation relative to the screen may differ for these input devices.
* Use and interactnions have become more complex, because people need more control over the objects no their screens.
* Both require learning and practice to become proficient.

### Pen tablets

* The surface of the tablet is a mirror of the coordinate system on the screen.
* Use and interaction can be more difficult to learn and master, because it requires precise spatial and motor control.

### Clicking and tapping

* The most familiar and frequent interactions with easily recognized outcomes.
* Tapping on screens is more direct than using a mause.

### Signals and cues

* Anything may be tapped on a touchscreen, so we need to provide signals about which elements are actually interactive.
* Depth cues, such as shadows, layers, and textures, can make on-screen objects look like they can be touched.

### Target size

Small and/or faraway targets are harder to reach and tap quickly and accurately. Instead, use larger and/or near targts.

## Gestures

* Gestures leave no trace.
* Accidental gestures may go unnoticed and may be difficult to undo.
* Hidden, complex, and arbitrary gestures are difficult to learn and remember.
* Use gestures consistently and in familiar ways whenever possible.

Common gestures:

* Tap
* Double-tap
* Long or hard press
* Scroll
* Pan
* Drag
* Swipe
* Flick
* Pinch
* Spear
* Rotate
* Multi-touch

Device gestures:

* Orient
* Shake
* Flip

### Siganls and cues for gestures

* Buttons and icons are perceivable, but gestures are invisible.
* Previews, hints, and motion can be used to indicate that gestural intereaction is possible.
* Demos and instructions can show how to gesture.

### Arbitrary and abstract gestures

* Multi-touch gestures may be powerful, but they can be difficult to discover.
* Multi-touch gestures vary across brands and products, which makes learning, generalization, and transfer of experience even more difficult.

## Voice

Voice recognition and speech synthesis have been available for decades. It still evolving and improving. People are very good at understanding context, reference, intent, and non-verbal communication, computers are not -yet-.

> We need to design to help people learn what to say and how to say it while we wait for technology to catch up to our expectations.

### Principles for Voice Interaction

* **Reveal**: when voice interaction is available and ready.
* **Guide**: what people can say and the actions the product can perform for them.
* **Repeat**: repeat the request and provide options and examples when asking for clarification.
* **Tell**: state the request when delivering results or performing actions on their behalf.
* **Respect**: be polite, friendly, concise, considerate, and unobstructive.

## Sensors

Sensors gather data from the environment around the device.

They are:

* Camera
* Microphone
* Photometer
* Accelerometer
* Gyroscope
* Compass
* Thermometer
* Barometer
* Altimeter
* Magnetometer
* Proximity

And more.

### Uses for Sensor Data

* Context may be better understood with location and environmental data.
* Monitor health and fitness.
* Learn about nearby things with audio and image recognition.
* Automatic device adjustments for improved usability.

### Privacy and Security about on sensors

* Data collected is often personal and may be sufficient to indetify the person.
* Be transparent about what is collected and how it is used.
* Offer clear and findable privacy and security controls.

## Microinteractions

Microinteractions are the small, naunced reactions of a product that **provide information and feedback**.

Dan Saffer studied microinteractions extensively and indetified four parts:

* **Triggrs**: signal or cue that something has happened or will happen.
* **Rules**: determine the conditions under which microinteractions occur and define what will happen.
* **Feedback**: verifies that the person has interacted with the product or that specific conditions have been met.
* **Loops and modes**: some interactions repeat (loop) intil the person stops it, others change the way a device work (mode) under certain conditions.

### Motion

Our brains are wired to be sensitive to **motion and change**. It draws and guides our attention trough the product.

Motion can also *distract*, stealing people's attention is unwanted and unwelcome. Use motion judiciously and with purpose.

#### Motion has meaning

* **Time**: animations and motion may communicate progress, transition, and status.
* **Space**: motion can help people understand spatial location and hierarchy.
* **Relationship**: connections, relationships, and associations can be clarified and highlighted.
* **Change**: shape, size, appearance, and/or location may transform in proportion to changes in value or meaning.
* **Opportunity**: indicate opportunities to interact, often with gestures, by mimicking the gesture with similar motion of the interactive elements on the screen.

#### Smooth Motion

**Abrupt changes feel mechanical and may be disriptuve**.

Easing is used to create smooth motion with acceleration, deceleration, and other physical effects.

Motion that embodies characteristics of the natural world can be more appealing.

### Sound

Sound is an important part of product design, but it can also *distract* or even *annoy*. It can enhance a product by providing information and contributing to positive emotions.

#### Sounds as icons

**Auditory icons** are sounds that correspond to something in the real world.

**Earcons** are arbitrary sounds we learn to associate with actions.

#### Sound has value and purpose

* **Direct attention**: attract and guide a person's attention to outcomes they requested or which require their response.
* **Provide feedback and information**: provide feedback and information about the status and progress of interactions and processes.
* **Support brand and identity**: sounds mey be identifiable and associated with a product's brand and identity.

### Haptics

It's **how people see and manipulate** objects using their senses of touch and proprioception.

#### Haptic feedback

* **Vibration**: making device vibrate may create different sensations.
* **Force**: it's used by mechanical systems to "push back" against interactions to simulate natural conditions of friction and resistance.
* **Texture**: surface textures may be simulated with vairable friction, and advanced materials may even make physical changes.

#### Vibration

* **Taps on the screens**: commonly acknowledged with rapid vibrations.
* **Hard or long press**: indicate when a press has been long or foceful enough to trigger the interaction.
* **Alarms and notifications**: sounds and vibration are commonly used in conjunction and increase effectiveness in environments with variable noise levels
* **Gestural feedback**: may be used to provide feedback during a gesture and at the end to indicate successful completion.

#### Some haptic feecback is real

Not all is simulated, physical buttons and sweitches provide real haptic feedback.

## Error handling

No matter how much we plan, things go wrong. Errors cause frustration, and error messages are important feedback and guidance.

> The best error handling is error prevention

### Effective error messages

1. Use natural language and never blame the person.
1. Clearly describe what went wrong.
1. Briefly axplain why it went wrong.
1. Recommend how to fix or resolve the error.

Make error messages noticeable and place them as near the error as possible.

There may be two messages:

1. A generic message that an error has occured, usually, in an easily noticed location.
1. A specific message about the error near where the error occurred.

### Presentation of Error Messages

1. Provide error messages as soon as possible.
1. Use color to draw attention and indicate urgency.
1. Subtle transitions can be used to remove an error message after a correction has been made.

## Mistakes

> When mistakes or errors are made, sometimes the best solution is **undo**.

### Error vs Mistake

An **error** occurs when an action or **process cannot be completed** correctly.

A **mistake** is an incorrect choice or information that **does not prevent the process from being completed**, but the end result is not anticipated or desired.

### Detecting mistakes

* Good feedback *confirms* that the action was performed and *reports the results* or outcomes.
* Important actions should provide the opportinuty to make corrections or be canceled.

## Usability and accessibility

Usability is the **ease of use** of the product or service.

Utility is the **usefulness and value** of the prodcut or service.

### Evaluating Usability

* Sufficient motivation or need can override poor usability.
* Just because someone completes a task, does not mean it was easy to do.
* We need to observe people using a product and interview them about their experience to better evaluate usability.

### Usability principles

#### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

* **Learnability**: how easily cana  new person learn to use the product?
* **Flexibility**: how many ways can a person interact with the product?
* **Robustness**: how well does the product help people when errors occur?

By Dix, Finlay, Abowl, and Beale.

#### Nielsen and Shneiderman

* **Learnability**: how easily cana  new person learn to use the product?
* **Efficiency**: how quickly and accurately can a person perform tasks?
* **Memorability**: how well do people remember a product if they have not used it recently?
* **Errors**: how many errors occur, and how well do people recover from them?
* **Satisfaction**: how much do people enjoy using a product, and are they satified with the results?

#### ISO 9241 - Five Principles

* **Learnability**: how easily cana  new person learn to use the product?
* **Understandability**: how well can people understand what they are seeing?
* **Operability**: how much controll does the person have within the product?
* **Attractiveness**: how visually appealing is the product?
* **Usability Compliance**: does the product adhere to documented standards?

### Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design

1. Strive for consistency.
1. Enable shortcuts for frequent actions.
1. Offer informative feedback.
1. Design dialogs to yeld closure.
1. Offer simple errror handling.
1. Permit easy revisal of actions.
1. Support internal locus of control.
1. Reduce short-term memory load.

By Ben Shneiderman, PhD.

### Accessibility

**All people shall be able** to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with a product, **regardless or their abilities**, and they can contribute equally.

Accessibility is often a legal requirement.

#### Basic accessibility

* Text should be structured for screen readers.
* Imagery should have descriptions.
* Videos should be captioned.
* Interfaces should be navigable and usable by multiple methods, including keyboard, mouse, touch, and voice.
