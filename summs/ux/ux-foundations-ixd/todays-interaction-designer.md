# Today's Interaction Designer

## Project types and deliverables

It's about **designing for the entire interconnected system**, the device, the interface, the context, the environment, **and the people**.

## Technical and software skills

Starting from pencil and paper or a whiteboard, to **understand, define, and frame the problem**.

To low-fidelity diagrams, models, and flows, that helps us **identify potencial directions**, missing information, and paths the project may take.

After that, we need to **translate the ideas**, from concepts in papers, **to pixels on screens**.

Even more, by making pixels alive, **we should put interactive prototypes in use**, in the hands of the people who will be using the product **to validate our ideas**.

## Related disciplines and fields of study

Interaction designers have knowledge and skills across several fields, but we often go deep in  afew specific areas. This allows us to **understand people and problems** from different perspectives and give us the capabilities in specific areas to solve those problems.

Any knowledge in the area, at the end, helps us to understand **People, Technology, and Design**.

## Resources and communities

There are tons of opportunities, **learn**, just learn.
