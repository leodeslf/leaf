# Don't Make Me Think

Written by Steve Krug.

## Guiding Principles

### Don't make me think

>Krig's first law of usability.

People doesn't read, *people does scan*, they should be capable of **instantly finding what they need** without waisting time and effort, where is it, how to use it, or even identifying more options. Webs should be *self-explanatory and speak the users language*.

If you can't make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.

### How we really use the Web

>Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through.

Sometimes *people doesn't use the Web the way we spect* as designers and developers.

*People is usually in a hurry*. As said before, **they don't read pages, they scan them**. We need (or want) to get something done fast. We try to find the closest option that looks relevant to us, even if it's not the right one.

In reality, most of the time people don't make an optimal choice, **people guess** and choose the most reasonable option. Usually getting wrong, but, when they're right, **it's faster**, surprising and pleasant.

Sometimes *people don't actually know how things work*, **they muddle through**. It's not important for them to ignore things, however, if they know, they'll feel smarter.

### Billboard Design 101

>Designing for scanning, not reading.

#### Take advantage of conventions

Standards and **conventions are the safest solutions**  (where the things are, how they work, how they look). Innovate when *you know you have a better idea* that is clear, self-explanatory, and doesn't hurt consistancy.

#### Create effective visual hierarchies

Make obvious which things are **more important**, what things **does**, and what things **are part of**. In other words show visual cues about *hierarchy*, *functionality* and *relationship*.

#### Break pages up into clearly defined areas

Divide the page into clearly defined areas so users can easily **decide which areas to focus** on, and what they can ignore.

#### Make it obvious what's clickable

On the Web, *almost all we can do are clicks*. Use visual cues to **show what's clickable**, color, shape, underlining, location, and more.

#### Eliminate distractions

Reduce visual noise. **Clamoring for attention, disorganizaiton, and clutter is overwhelming**. All of that leads to lots of noise, not much information, and noise obscures the usefull stuff.

#### Format content to support scanning

Use **headings** and make them distinctive. **Keep paragraphs short**, avoid creating a "wall of words". Use **bulleted lists** whenever you can. **Highlight key terms** when appropriate.

### Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

>Why users like mindless choices.

People don't care how many clicks they have to make, but **how much they have to think** to make them. If you know something is difficult, give some help, **guidance should be brief, timely, and unavoidable**.

### Omit needless words

>The art of not writing for the web.

By **writing less**, we reduce the noise level, make the useful content more prominent, and save time for the users. Try to avoid *happy talk*, *small talk*, and *instructions* on your products.

## Things You Need to Get Right

### Street signs and Breadcrumbs

>Designing navigation.

#### Web Navigation 101

- You're usually trying to find something.
- You decide whether to ask first or browse first.
- If you choose to browse, you use signs as guides.
- Eventually, if you can't find what you're looking for, you'll leave.

#### The unbearable lightness of browsing

We have to give the missing cues for the user, as while searching on the web we have **no sense of scale, direction, and location**.

#### The overlooked purposes of navigation

Navigation:

- Tells us **what's here**.
- Tells us **how to use** the site.
- Gives us **confidence** in the people who built it.

#### Web navigation conventions

Follow standards on **appearance and location of navigation systems**, so people can know *what to look* for and *where to look* when they need.

#### Don't look now, but I think it's following us

**Persistent navigation** (or *global navigation*) should say:

- Navigation is here...
- It will change a little as you navigate...
- But it will always be here...
- And it will always work the same way.

Persistent navigation usually contains the Site ID, Utilities, Sections, and a Search bar.

#### Did I say every page?

We need to **avoid unnecesary distractions while filling forms**, paying on an e-commerce, registering, or subscribing. It's fine to simplify the persistent navigation to ensure that people can finish these activities.

#### Now I know we're not in Kansas

Use the **Site ID as a sign** to let the people know where they are. Usually it will be on the **top left corner** of the site, that way it will frame the entire page.

#### The Sections

They are the **primary navigation**, they can show (while clicking or pointing) the subsections or *secondary navigation*.

#### The Utilities

They are even less prominent than the sections. They can **help people use the site**, usually presented as groups of *no more than four elements* (other elements whould be on the footer).

Some of the most common utility elements are:

- Sign In.
- Register.
- Your Account.
- Shopping Cart.
- About Us.
- Contact Us.
- Forums.
- Help.
- FAQs.

#### Just click youe heels three times and say, "There's no place like home"

Users spect to have access to the Site ID button at any time, so they can **_reset_ and go back to the home page** no matter how lost they are while navigating.

#### A way to search

Stick to the *formula* of **a box and a button labeled as "Search"** (or a magnifying glass icon).

Avoid:

- **Fancy wording**, "Search" is just the standard.
- **Instructions**, usually, no one needs them.
- **Options**, give options only after the search, when the user can actually decide if they are needed or not.

#### Secondary, tertiary, and whatever comes after tertiary

After primary and secondary navigation levels, we often **don't give priority for lower levels**.

That happens because:

- The **limited amount of space on the page**.
- The **limited time to design and develop**.
- And most important, the **people already knows how to use the page**, so navigation is *not needed* enymore when they reaches these lower levels.

#### Page names, or Why I love to drive in L.A

In L.A.:

- Street signs are big.
- They'r in the right place.

Four things about page names:

- **Every page needs a name**: even when it's highlighted in the navigation.
- The name needs to be in **the right place**: it should be framing it's content.
- The name needs to be **prominent**: use position, size, color, and typeface for it.
- The name needs to **match what I clicked**: when it happens it gives confort and trust.

#### "You are here"

To counteract the "lost in space" feeling on the Web, we need to **highlight the current location** on the navigation bar, list, or menu elements.

We can do this by adding cues like:

- A pointer.
- Bold text.
- Different text color.
- Different background color.

#### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs allows users to **back up a level or go Home**. They're most useful in **large sites with a deep hierarchy**, self explanatory, and don't take up much room.

Best practices:

- Put them at the top.
- Use ">" between levels.
- Boldface the last item (as "You are here").

#### Three reasons why I still love tabs

Tabs are one of the only few physical metaphors used in UIs, easy to identify and use. Effective when we **bring the active one to the front** and use a distinctive shape and color to make them "pop" on the screen.

They're:

- **Self evident**.
- **Hard to miss** (they perfectly divide the navigation from the content).
- **Slick** (easy to customize and apply).

#### Try the trunk test

No matter where you are on a Web site, or if you have use it before or not, **you should always be able to answer these questions** at a glance:

- What site is this? (Site ID)
- What page am I on? (Page name)
- What are the majore sections of this site? (Sections)
- What are my options at this level? (Local navigation)
- Where am I in the scheme of things? ("You are here" indicators)
- How can I search?

### The Big Bang Theory of Web Design

>The importance of getting people off on the right foot.

**Designing the Home page** can be complex, here you need to cover all the bases, and, *a few other things*:

- Site identity and mission.
- Site hierarchy (for content and features).
- Search.
- Teases (good staff).
- Content promos.
- Feature promos.
- Timely content.
- Deals (ads., cross-promotion, co-branding).
- Shortcuts (for the most frequently requested content).
- Registration.
- Show me what I'm looking for.
- ...and what I'm not looking for.
- Show me where to start.
- Stablish credibility and trust.

#### And you have to do it...blindfolded

About the Home page:

- **Everybody wants a piece of it**, people who makes it, and people who uses it, may have different points of view or different needs and interests, then the available and the desired content on the Home page may not be the same.
- **Too many cooks**, everyone ends up with a different opinion about it.
- **One size fits all**, the Home page is the only one that has to appeal to everyone.

#### The First Casuality of War

As said, we tend to put a lot of thing in the Home page, but we can't. We start filtering and removing things and sometimes we get rid of the most important one, **to make it easy to see the big picture**.

Questions that a Home page has to answer:

- What is this?
- What can I do here?
- What do they have here?
- Why should I be here and not somewhere else?

It's better if we can answer these questions at a glance and with very little effort. **The first few seconds you spend on a new Web site are critical**, (that's the Big Bang Theory of Web Design). **People often form wrong ideas** of what things are and how they work, so they end up creating more misinterpretations.

##### The Top Four Plausible Excuses for not Spelling Out the Big Picture on the Home Page

1. **"We don't need to. It's obvious"**: No, it's not obvious for everybody.
1. **"After people have seen the explanation once, they'll find it annoying"**: No, it will not (and should not) be annoying at all.
1. **"Anybody who really needs our site will know what it is"**: No, even the people who needs it, may not "get" it if done wrong.
1. **"That's what our advertising is for"**: No, the TV/radio/Web/print ads not necessarily will be remembered when people gets to the site.

#### But...the Home page? Really?

Even knowing that nowadays most of times **people gets on a site from an external link**, the behavior tends to be that: **if they like what they see, they will visit the home page** to see who made it and what more they can find.

#### How to get the message across

There are three things to make it clear **what the site is about**:

- **The tagline**: it's a valuable space next to the Site ID, we read it as a description of the whole site.
- **The welcome blurb**: a terce description of the site.
- **The "Learn more"**: people have become accostumated to watching short explanatory videos, they don't have the patience for a fair amount of explanation.

People will often *get it* without even notice these three elements. But if they can't guess, there should be a place where they can go fint out.

A few guidelines for **getting the message across**:

- **Use as much space as necessary**: it's the main goal, so make sure you *do it well*.
- **...but don't use any more space than necessary**: if you can, *leave some space* to other things.
- **Don't use a mission statement as a Welcome blurb**: truth is that *nobody cares*.
- **It's one of the most important things to test**: you can't trust your own judgment, just *people from outside* can tell you what's missing.

#### Nothing beats a good tagline!™

A tagline is a pithy phrase that characterizes the whole enterprise, summing up **what it is** and **what makes it great**.

>A good tagline is one that no one else in the world could use except you.
>
>Jakob Nielsen.

Good taglines are:

- Clear and informative.
- Just long enough, but not too long.
- Good at conveying differentiation and clear benefits.
- Not generic.
- Personable, lively, and sometimes clever.

#### Tagline? We don't need no stinking tagline

Some sites don't actually need taglines. When they come from an already achieved **household word status**, or they are well known from their **offline origins**. Even in these cases, sites would benefit from a tagline.

#### The fifth question

Once we know **what we are looking at**, we need to answer **where to start if I want to**:

- Search?
- Browse?
- Sample their best stuff?

If it's a step-by-step process site, it should be obvious, if not, it should be easy to find, for example, the log in or sign In buttons. Unfortunately, the *need to promote everything* can obscure the important stuff. Then we need to make the **entry points visible**. It helps to label them like "Search", "Sign in", "Start here", etc.

#### Why Golden Geese make such tempting targets

One of the worst behaviors is to **try to promote everything**.

Promoting things in the Home page guarantees more traffic to the promoted section. The cost of a promotional overload is an **overall loss in effectiveness** of the Home page as it gets overpopulated.

That's *The Tragedy of the Commons*.

>Any shared resource (a "commons") will inevitabely be destroyed by overuse.

## Making Sure You Got them Right

### "The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends"

> Why most arguments about usability are a waste of time, and how to avoid them.

The team (PMs, designers, marketing, devs, etc) needs to make decisions about usability. Unfortunately they/we end up having an **endless discussion** consisting of *personal beliefs* that cannot be proven, such as a "religious debate".

Instead of solving problems, these *arguments* create **tension** among the team members, and result in a **waste of time**.

#### "Everybody likes ___."

We are not only Web *creators*, are also Web *users*. So we have our own feelings and opinions about it. Often, we tend to think that others like and dislike the same as we do. **We tend to think that most users are like us**.

That happens even when we actually know that *other people* can hate what we like, in fact, some of them belong to our own Web team. Not always *sensible* people, there aren't many of them.

#### Farmers vs. cowmen

On top of that personal passion, we have the **professional passion**. We don't only have our own point of view about each specific element, but about the whole **target** of the project.

I.e., devs tend to like ingenious features, while designers enjoy plesant visual experiences. And maybe the CEO doesn't care about any of these things and just wants to make something that came out from a dream (true story).

#### The myth of the Average User

While building a Web site, we figure out that not only team members are different from each other, they are different from the Web user, and even more, **each Web user is different** from each other.

Then, thinking that *most* Web users are like *anything* is just a myth. **There is no Average User**.

>All Web users are unique and all Web use is basically idiosyncratic.

Each Web user has it's own intentions, motivations, knowledge, etc. Their individual reactions are based on **so many variables** that it's almost impossible to describe the Average User. It's even **counter-productive**.

There is no "right" answer to design questions, thay just need to be carefully thought out, well executed, and tested. There are some things we should *never* do, and some others that we should *rarely* do, but usually Web teams don't even argue about these ones.

#### The antidote for relogious debates

At the end, **there is no point in trying to generalize**, saying what is *good* and what is *bad*. What we really need is a **specific solution** for a specific problem in a specific context.

The only thing that *is good* is the one that works. And the only way to know it is by **testing**. There's no substitute fot it.

We have to use our **collective skill**, experience, creativity, and common sense to build "the solution". Whatch people as they try and (if possible) finally use it. That's all.

Debates about what *we like* and what *the user (supposedly) likes* are just a waste of time and energy, what really matters is what **works**.

### Usability testing on 10 cents a day
