      <h2>Today's Interaction Designer (1/5)</h2>
<p>Interaction Design was introduced by Bill Moggride and Bil Verplank in mid-1980s.</p>
<h3>Project types and deliverables</h3>
<p>It's about <strong>designing for the entire interconnected system</strong>, the device, the interface, the context, the environment, <strong>and the people</strong>.</p>
<h3>Technical and software skills</h3>
<p>Starting from pencil and paper or a whiteboard, to <strong>understand, define, and frame the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>To low-fidelity diagrams, models, and flows, that helps us <strong>identify potential directions</strong>, missing information, and paths the project may take.</p>
<p>After that, we need to <strong>translate the ideas</strong>, from concepts in papers, <strong>to pixels on screens</strong>.</p>
<p>Even more, by making pixels alive, <strong>we should put interactive prototypes in use</strong>, in the hands of the people who will be using the product <strong>to validate our ideas</strong>.</p>
<h3>Related disciplines and fields of study</h3>
<p>Interaction designers have knowledge and skills across several fields, but we often go deep in a few specific areas. This allows us to <strong>understand people and problems</strong> from different perspectives and give us the capabilities in specific areas to solve those problems.</p>
<p>Any knowledge in the area, at the end, helps us to understand <strong>People, Technology, and Design</strong>.</p>
<h3>Resources and communities</h3>
<p>There are tons of opportunities, <strong>learn</strong>, just learn.</p>
