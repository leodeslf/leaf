      <h2>The Interaction Design Model (4/5)</h2>
<p>The behavior on the <em>interaction design model</em> is the actual interaction with the product, and it has its own cycle.</p>
<pre class="language-txt"><code class="language-txt">... --><br>--> PERCEIVE --><br>--> PREDICT --><br>--> INTERACT --><br>--> FEEDBACK --><br>--> LEARN --><br>--> PRACTICE / REMEMBER --><br>--> ...</code></pre>
<h3>Perceive</h3>
<p>People are less likely to interact if they do not perceive the opportunity to interact, even if they need or want to interact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People must understand there are things they can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good design solutions <strong>increase the perceivability</strong> of opportunities to interact as well as <strong>inform people</strong> about the appropriate or correct ways to interact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We bring our past experiences and learning to every new experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Perceivability</h4>
<ul>
<li>More than just a visual signal and cues.</li>
<li><strong>All content and interactions must be accessible for all people</strong>.</li>
<li>Gestures and voice interaction often lack perceivable signals and cues, so people often do not know what they can do or say</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiple possible interactions</h4>
<ul>
<li>MAny products offer many functions and services, but usually need only one a few per use.</li>
<li>We quickly process our options and select the most salient and relevant, and then ignore the rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Predict</h3>
<h4>Confidence</h4>
<p>If people are confident that their interaction with a product will help them achieve their goals, then the probability of interaction increases.</p>
<h4>Deciding among options</h4>
<p>When there are different ways to complete a task, people decide based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context</li>
<li>Goal</li>
<li>Prior experience</li>
<li>Perceivability</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>Three stages of feedback</h4>
<h5>Interaction acknowledged</h5>
<p>An immediate response to a person's interaction and request. The product acknowledges that they have done something.</p>
<p>Techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hovers, rollovers, and down states.</li>
<li>Transitions for size, rotation, and location.</li>
<li>Modal layers and dialogs appear or disappear.</li>
<li>Sound and vibration.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Request in progress</h5>
<p>Interim feedback to indicate that the product is still working on the request and provides progress information.</p>
<p>Techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deactivate states with status messages.</li>
<li>Progress indicators for time, amount, or simply ongoing.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Results of interaction</h5>
<p>The final feedback is the actual result or output of the product in response to a person's request.</p>
<p>Final feedback forms and variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to a new page or screen.</li>
<li>Modal layers and dialogs.</li>
<li>Update content on the current page.</li>
<li>Control media playback.</li>
<li>Control game play.</li>
<li>Error message.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ambient feedback</h4>
<ul>
<li>Subtle, continuous change to the interface that provides useful information at a glance.</li>
<li>It usually conveys information about a single variable in a simple way.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Anticipatory feedback</h4>
<ul>
<li>Information is provided before a person interacts to help them understate what the outcomes may be.</li>
<li>Improves the accuracy of predictions.</li>
<li>Helps people avoid interactions that are not likely to help them achieve their goals.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Making meaning of feedback</h4>
<ul>
<li>We put cognitive effort into making sense of feedback</li>
<li>Is the outcome meaningful?</li>
<li>Does the outcome match the prediction?</li>
<li>Does the outcome help the person get closer to the goal?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Value of outcomes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Meaningful outcomes that match predictions and move people toward their goals are more useful and valuable.</li>
<li>The probability of continued interaction with the product increases.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Feedback bring emotions</h4>
<p>Useful outcomes and meaningful feedback create positive experiences, instill trust, and may even delight people.</p>
<h3>Learn</h3>
<h4>Practice to learn</h4>
<ul>
<li>We observe our own behavior and the outcomes that occur.</li>
<li>Repeated interactions strengthen the associations and improve the accuracy of predictions.</li>
<li>The more we practice, the faster and more accurate our interactions with the product become.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Intuitive Design</h4>
<p>Even when products are &quot;intuitive&quot;, they may require multiple uses and practice before people learn and remember how to interact.</p>
<h3>Remember</h3>
<h4>Memory and remembering</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensory Store</strong>: during the perceive phase we process all incoming information and identify the important elements.</li>
<li><strong>Working Memory</strong>: during the feedback and learning phases we process information for meaning and associations.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term Memory</strong>: during the remember phase we store learned information (and skills) for future use.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transfer</h4>
<ul>
<li>We recognize products we have used before, may remember how to use them, and recall and ew-use what we learned.</li>
<li>We notice similarities between prior experiences and new products, transfer what we learned from earlier product experiences, and apply those skills and knowledge to the new products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, we can mismatch, confuse, or even forget what we have learned.</p>
