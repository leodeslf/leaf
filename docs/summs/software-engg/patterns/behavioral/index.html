<p>Quick notes from <a href="https://refactoring.guru/">Refactoring.Guru</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong> between objects.</p>
<h3>Chain of responsibility</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/chain-of-responsibility-mini.png" alt="Chain of responsibility"></p>
<p>Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.</li>
<li>The set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Command</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/command-mini.png" alt="Command"></p>
<p>It turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to parameterize objects with operations.</li>
<li>You want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.</li>
<li>You want to implement reversible operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Iterator</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/iterator-mini.png" alt="Iterator"></p>
<p>Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its complexity from clients.</li>
<li>Reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.</li>
<li>You want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of these structures are unknown beforehand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mediator</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/mediator-mini.png" alt="Mediator"></p>
<p>Lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Itâ€™s hard to change some of the classes because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other classes.</li>
<li>Can't reuse a component in a different program because it's too dependent on other components.</li>
<li>Find yourself creating tons of component subclasses just to reuse some basic behavior in various contexts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Memento</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/memento-mini.png" alt="Memento"></p>
<p>Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to produce snapshots of the objectâ€™s state.</li>
<li>Direct access to the objectâ€™s fields/getters/setters violates its encapsulation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Observer</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/observer-mini.png" alt="Observer"></p>
<p>Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects.</li>
<li>Some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>State</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/state-mini.png" alt="State"></p>
<p>Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state.</li>
<li>You have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves.</li>
<li>You have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/strategy-mini.png" alt="Strategy"></p>
<p>Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object.</li>
<li>You have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.</li>
<li>You want to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.</li>
<li>Your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Template Method</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/template-method-mini.png" alt="Template Method"></p>
<p>Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm.</li>
<li>You have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visitor</h3>
<p><img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/visitor-mini.png" alt="Visitor"></p>
<p>Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.</p>
<p>Use it when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure.</li>
<li>You want to clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors.</li>
<li>A behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
