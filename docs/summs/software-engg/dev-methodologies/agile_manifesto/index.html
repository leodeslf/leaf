      <h2>Agile Manifesto</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools.</li>
<li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation.</li>
<li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>Our highest priority is to <em>satisfy the customer</em> through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li><em>Welcome changing requirements</em>, even late in development. Agile processes harness for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
<li><em>Deliver working software frequently</em>, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must <em>work together daily</em> throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around <em>motivated individuals</em>. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is <em>face-to-face conversation</em>.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary <em>measure of progress</em>.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote <em>sustainable development</em>. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to <em>technical excellence and good design</em> enhances agility.</li>
<li><em>Simplicity</em> -the art of maximizing the amount of work not done- is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from <em>self-organizing teams</em>.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then <em>tunes and adjusts</em> its behavior accordingly.</li>
</ol>
